## What is this respository for?

[ecoevojobs.net](http://ecoevojobs.net) is a widely-used community board for academic jobs in ecology, evolutionary biology, and related disciplines. However, the ecoevojobs spreadsheet has relatively little information automatically included about the institution where the job posting is.

Once per hour, this repository automatically pulls public information from [the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education](https://carnegieclassifications.acenet.edu/) and merges it into the ecoevojobs spreadsheet.

[You can find the most-recently updated faculty jobs listing file here](https://github.com/mikeblazanin/ecoevojobsR/blob/master/data-raw/ecoevojobsR_faculty.csv)

[You can find the most-recently updated postdoc jobs listing file here](https://github.com/mikeblazanin/ecoevojobsR/blob/master/data-raw/ecoevojobsR_postdoc.csv)

If you have any suggestions or see any errors, email me! mikeblazanin@gmail.com

If you'd like to see how this works, or want to download the script to play around with yourself, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a folder. Open R and set your working directory to this folder.
2. Download and save the [ecoevo_jobs_analysis.R](https://github.com/mikeblazanin/ecoevojobsR/blob/master/R/ecoevo_jobs_analysis.R) file into that folder
3. Create a `data-raw` subfolder
4. Download and save the files in [data-raw](https://github.com/mikeblazanin/ecoevojobsR/tree/master/data-raw) into that subfolder
5. Run ecoevo_jobs_analysis.R (with the working directory in the parent folder). The script should automatically update the `ecoevojobsR_faculty.csv` and `ecoevojobsR_postdocs.csv` files.

Note that some institution names are unable to be matched automatically. When this happens, the script checks the `aliases.csv` file, which I've manually filled in with previous listed institution names from ecoevojobs and the corresponding name in the Carnegie Classifications. If some new names are not found in `aliases.csv`, during execution `ecoevo_jobs_analysis.R` will print statement with the number of institutions for which this is true. 

If you'd like to manually tell the script how to match those:

1. Find the `aliases_new1.csv` and `aliases_new2.csv` files that were created by running the script, they should be located in the `data-raw` folder
2. Copy-paste the rows from those files where the `checked` column is `N` into the `aliases.csv` file
3. For each institution, find the corresponding row in the `Data` tab of the `CCIHE2021-PublicData.xlsx` file. 
4. Copy-paste the `name` from that row in `CCIHE2021-PublicData.xlsx` into the `carnegie_name` column of the corresponding row in `aliases.csv`
