## What is this respository for?

[ecoevojobs.net](http://ecoevojobs.net) is a widely-used community board for academic jobs in ecology, evolutionary biology, and related disciplines. However, the ecoevojobs spreadsheet has relatively little information automatically included about the institution where the job posting is.

This repository automatically pulls public information from [the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education](https://carnegieclassifications.acenet.edu/) and merges it into the ecoevojobs spreadsheet.

[You can find the most-recently updated faculty jobs listing file here](https://github.com/mikeblazanin/ecoevojobsR/blob/master/data-raw/ecoevojobsR_faculty.csv)

[You can find the most-recently updated postdoc jobs listing file here](https://github.com/mikeblazanin/ecoevojobsR/blob/master/data-raw/ecoevojobsR_postdoc.csv)

Note that I couldn't figure out an easy way to automate the updating of these spreadsheets. If you have an idea how that could be done, email me! mikeblazanin@gmail.com. Otherwise, they'll be updated when I can, or when people ask me to.

If you want an up-to-date version for yourself and don't want to wait on me, you can simply follow these steps:

1. Create a folder. Open R and set your working directory to this folder.
2. Download and save the [ecoevo_jobs_analysis.R](https://github.com/mikeblazanin/ecoevojobsR/blob/master/R/ecoevo_jobs_analysis.R) file into that folder
3. Create a `data-raw` subfolder
4. Download and save the files in [data-raw](https://github.com/mikeblazanin/ecoevojobsR/tree/master/data-raw) into that subfolder
5. Download the latest ecoevojobs spreadsheet as an Excel file, and overwrite the existing `ecoevojobs 22-23.xlsx` file
6. Run ecoevo_jobs_analysis.R (with the working directory in the parent folder). The script should automatically update the `ecoevojobsR_faculty.csv` and `ecoevojobsR_postdocs.csv` files.

Note that some institution names may be unable to be matched automatically. If this is the case, during execution `ecoevo_jobs_analysis.R` will print statement with the number of institutions for which this is true. 

If you'd like to manually tell the script how to match those:

1. Find the `aliases_new1.csv` and `aliases_new2.csv` files that were created by running script, they should be located in the `data-raw` folder
2. Copy-paste the rows from those files where the `checked` column is `N` into the `aliases.csv` file
3. For each institution, find the corresponding row in the `Data` tab of the `CCIHE2021-PublicData.xlsx` file. 
4. Copy-paste the `name` from that row in `CCIHE2021-PublicData.xlsx` into the `carnegie_name` column of the corresponding row in `aliases.csv`
