She or he will have the opportunity to develop collaborations with The Nature Conservancy’s and Conservation International’s Natural Climate Solutions teams in addition to the NAU community.","Northern Arizona University",FALSE,"AZ",105330,"Flagstaff","R2 Doctoral Universities: High Research Activity","Balanced arts & sciences/professions, some graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Comprehensive programs, no medical/veterinary school","Four-year, full-time, inclusive, higher transfer-in","High undergraduate","Four-year, large, primarily residential","Not Classified","Southwest AZ NM OK TX","Public, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Public",1,"City Small","No","No","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,6403,1276,71,142,0,7892,62548,1908,45,748,6,6,18,41,30,41,260,1158,2627,3776,0,48,30733,34290,29566,25102,25228,4338,20642,4238,0,348,2228,2110,4589,628,1614,703,NA,NA,25,51,NA,1247,0.158008,69,73,34,0.492754,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",1,0,0,18,9,10144,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,37386,30523,0.816429,1
