Despite its significance, the origins of date palm diversity remain shrouded in mystery. Notably, distinct genepools have been recognized in West Asia and North Africa. Positioned at the crossroads of these genepools and civilizations for countless millennia, the Levant emerges as a pivotal region. However, the precise origins of date palm cultivation in the region and the sources of these genepools continue to elude us.
In this compelling research endeavor, our objective is to characterize the date palm populations in the southern Levant, and unravel their cultivation origin. Through the comprehensive analysis of numerous modern and ancient genomes across the region, as well as seed morphometric data from both modern and archaeological seeds, we aim to study the intricate interplay of biological, ecological, historical, and human factors that have shaped the diverse landscape of date palms in the southern Levantine region. This multidisciplinary approach will provide invaluable insights into the demographic and selective processes that have influenced the diversity of date palms, facilitating the development of effective conservation and improvement programs.","International",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This research opportunity with EPA will leverage recently developed geospatial methods and datasets (Leibowitz et al. 2023; https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-023-00057-w) to hydrologically link several million existing and potentially-restorable wetlands to upslope nutrient sources and downstream waters. Specifically, this research will bring together EPA and other federal geospatial datasets of existing wetlands, potentially-restorable wetlands (https://rb.gy/bd0), stream and/or lake network hydrology (StreamCat and/or LakeCat), and landscape nutrient inventories into a connected framework that will allow for optimization of wetland restoration scenarios within several million watersheds of the conterminous US.

The first position will focus on mapping and measuring changes to ecosystem services and associated benefits from Great Lakes coastal ecosystem restoration efforts. This research will include measuring how benefits change due to climate change, particularly future change in lake levels. The goal of this project is to forecast how changes in ecosystem services could influence human communities within neighborhoods and urban areas. Ideal candidates could have experience in one or more of the following fields: ecology, biology, environmental science, epidemiology, public health, geography, environmental economics, or a related field.
The second position will focus on community resources and capacities. This project intends to use social science case study methodologies to better understand community values, decisions, abilities, and actions in relation to environmental concerns. Ideal candidates could have experience in one or more of the following fields: geography, environmental studies, anthropology, sociology, or a related field.
Work from both of these postdoctoral positions will support ongoing remediation and restoration projects led by EPA Great Lakes National Program Office. The postdocs will join an interdisciplinary team of researchers including social scientists and ecologists focused on translational ecology, an approach in which scientists, stakeholders, and decision makers together develop solutions that address sociological, ecological, and political contexts of environmental problems. The PI’s leading this work include Joel Hoffman (hoffman.joel@epa.gov), Katie Williams (williams.kathleen@epa.gov), and Samantha Rumschlag (rusmchlag.samantha@epa.gov). Interested candidates should be in touch via email ahead of the job posting to express interest. The job posting will occur towards the end of May via Zintellect (https://www.zintellect.com/), where candidates can apply.
