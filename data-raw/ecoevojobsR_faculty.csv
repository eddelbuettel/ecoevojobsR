I think this is a great position for someone who is entirely focused on research and has no interest in teaching or outreach. You can build your own research program, but institutional support is more limited than what you would generally find at a traditional academic institution. There is a lot of pressure to bring in large federal grants, but if you feel confident in your ability to do so, it can be an excellent opportunity for the correct person. 6). I'm a scientist at Cary. Salary is competetive with top notch institutions. It is a hard money position with a community goal of recovering a portion of salary. Feel free to reach out to the search committee with any questions. Many many opportunities for outreach and teaching if interested. Communitity is caring and egaged. 7) Yeah, pretty shocked at people roasting this position. Looks amazing. You can also get an idea of org salaries, at least at the top, from 990s since it's an NGO, if you're so worried before applying. Look at the caliber of people there, though. It's clearly a good place. 8) where is this position being ""roasted""? I am not seeing that and it looks like they updated the listing to include salary. 9) I disagree with the statement that this is a position for someone who ""has no interest in outreach or teaching"". Not being a University does mean there is less teaching, but there are still plenty of opportunities to teach if the scientist is interested. Also, the amount of outreach Cary scientists do is often more than a tradition academic position due to the time release of not having consistent teaching requirements.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

They didn't ask for someone in evolution (her), they asked for broad bio and are asking for new course expansion in the department. 9) I don't know even for an internal VAP hire they likely still have to post and run a national search. Any individual person is of course going to be much narrower than this (frankly ridiculous...make up your mind) 'biology' search. 10) A broad search most likely generate a solid pool that they can use to justify hiring an internal VAP. If they post something tailored people will pick up on it. Remember the UNH acoustic search? x2 11) Agree with 9 and 10. If there is another line for that VAP, I think it would also have to be a full national search. So until we see another ad, I'm not going to believe that this position isn't for her.

This took 1-2 months. 2nd-highest canidate was offered the job, turned it down because they are a postdoc and want to remain fully research-focused - this one does need a new Msc-level module. **I would strongly encourage past applicants to apply** - when there are are 50+ candidates, half of them are typically excellent... so the shortlisting process isn't random but its hard for it to be great - but one shouldn't interpret not being shortlisted as a rejection. 4) Recently my university hosted a researcher working at the School of Biological & Behavioural Sciences working in this particular field and in an informal conversation sHe expressed a very good impression of the departmentand and working conditions.

If it works like our school's rules, they have to secure the hire more urgently but start date could still be flexible.  I have no inside info, but would recommend applying if interested. 3) In addition to quick turnaround, the desired focus is incredibly specific. 4) App State's website says 'open till filled' and review of applications begins on 6/19, not closes. Whether there is an internal canidate I have no insight. 5) For schools of this type/size/tier, teaching needs are often prioritized, which could explain the fall start and specificity. 6) Did you read the job ad 5? The research topic is insanely specific not the teaching requests. 7) @6, while I agree the research topics are pointed I wouldn't say insanely specific. Could be an internal hire, but could just as easily be a retirement with that expertise. 8) @6 I (5) did read it. Endowed positions, cluster hires (e.g., as part of a new research center), or donor- or industry-funded faculty positions can explain the narrow specificity of research hires. 9) ""particular interest in candidates with expertise in tropical ecology, reptile biology and biogeography"" 10) Might as well apply and see what happens is my motto at this point! 11.) For context: They had an almost identical job ad 2 years ago and the search failed. It was complicated (something about how the position was created, funded, supported, etc-- internal stuff w/ admin led to failed search). Maybe someone from UNCA can chime in? Seems like they just got an actual TT line to hire that person. 12) Yeah, by all means apply. But I totally disagree with 8. This job ad is either really badly written, or written to describe a specific person's research program. Of course that doesn't necessarily mean they would hire whoever that person is. 13) UNCA is not who is hiring for this position. 11 again: SORRY- you are right. This ad is so similar to the unca one that I got confused... ignore me :( 14) this is likely a spousal accommodation hire.  14) do a Google search on the keywords of add.  one person comes up.  a former postdoc at Yale working as staff at Colby.   look at faculty at ASU, any connections to Yale or Colby?  maybe coincidence.  apply anyway!!! 15) Just recieved this lol ""Due to changes in the position, we are going to cancel this posting and reassess the business need and revise the position Assistant Professor of Biology, Evolutionary and Global Change Ecology, 088601.

Just some comments from someone who was in the dept and is in this research field 7) the only way i'd work at a school in florida is if i could actually be in outer space most of the time x2  8) I have a colleague who could be a great fit for this, but the political backdrop is unsafe for one of his family members.  So he probably won't apply.  It's really unfortunate for a department that should recruit well otherwise. 9) I have a feeling at @7 is not a field biologist. Despite politics, there are a lot of reasons some biologists want to work in FL. x5 10) Yes. Gainesville is great (I don't live there, but would like to!) 11) 7 here, i am definitely a field biologist. i have no desire to live somewhere that is on the fast track to fascism. @9, i have a feeling you are a straight white christian man. 12) it's me, the real 7, looks like your counting is a bit off, and maybe we could not insult each other, going straight (pun intended) for identity instead of the argument, i mean, didn't we all take debate in 7th grade, attack the statement not the person, @ the false 7 and false 9, i mean with all the animosity online, i would like to think the highly educated could just not, academia is stressful enough in the job hunt, a safe forum for information sharing is a very low bar to clear","","University of Florida",FALSE,"FL",134130,"Gainesville","R1 Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity","Balanced arts & sciences/professions, high graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Comprehensive programs, with medical/veterinary school","Four-year, full-time, more selective, higher transfer-in","Majority undergraduate","Four-year, large, primarily residential","Not Classified","Southeast AL AR FL GA KY LA MS NC SC TN VA WV","Public, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Public",1,"City Midsize","Yes","Yes","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",152,9923,3881,679,1180,0,15815,889677,52546,677,2358,56,40,434,149,530,149,1657,3404,4669,5254,0,160,52407,58857,53372,47038,34931,18441,31219,3018,257,437,12395,6046,6301,32,1555,194,NA,NA,27,52,NA,2123,0.13424,84,208,67,0.797619,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,1,26,21,10161,5133,3172,650,640,1290,29,27,27.763877,48193,15002,0.31129,3

There's been a lot from this school for how small it is in the past few years 2) This seems to be the same ad that was posted in October just with the specialization in ornithology removed and some wording added about genetics and microbial ecology. Anyone have any insight about what might be going on here? Is this really two new positions? 3) date posted say 4/18 so either new or a readvertisment 4] Committee Memeber here...we are growing very rapidly [~ 1/3 of the student body is wildlife/biology (w/ pre-vet specializtion)], we did fill one postion in the fall [ornithology] but failed to fill the other opening in terrestrial/spatial ecology...the re-posting was done incorrectly by HR...a new posting will be put up late this week/early next, I apologize for the confusion 5) Is this position tenure track? ad does not say and online suggests maybe this place does not have tenure..#4 here [Committee memeber] have a have a series of three one-year contracts than two three-year contracts that become five-year contracts [a bit unusual for sure]...it's certainly not traditional tenure but it works--our department have never released a faculty member who secured a three-year contract 6) Would absolutely love to have an opportunity here, unfortunately I'm an aquatic ecologist and invert systematist and LMC doesn't seem to be interested in these areas even though they translate to prepping students for jobs with state and federal agencies.7) If you are absolutely fine with having no support for research, having an unreasonably high teaching load (and administrative since everyone is constantly leaving this place), being asked to make your courses easier, and on top of that being underpaid (or have no other choice), go for this. 8) @7 are you speaking from experience? Any other red flags, details like pay range, etc.? Can't find anything reliable. 9) If they want a terrestrial/spatial ecologist why don't they just say so? Don't waste applicants' time applying for something they have no shot at being selected for. 7) Yes. My biggest complain is that there is a culture of exploitation of faculy and staff (incl. to be expected to participate in all sorts of recruitment events) with administrators not doing everything in their power to improve the criminally low salaries (40-46K range in my case) in a really expensive area of NC (From Zillow: the average Banner Elk home value is $461,586). It is a shame, because the college would otherwise have an amazing potential, but it is run like a pyramid scheme and I doubt degrees from the college mean anything but that the student could afford to go there. 10) @ 7 Thank you for your input. That place sounds like a hot mess. 7) You are welcome! I would recommend anyone to check all of the details of the teaching load (how course load is calculated) in this department, and see other pretty negative glassdoor reviews. 11) I applied last cycle for this position, I knew the salary was potentially going to be low but I didn't realize how low until a heard the offer. I was offered a position, in addition to my wife getting an offer, a day after hearing from this college. I currently make double the offered salary. It is tough for a small college to offer a significant salary, but it would have been tough to leave my well funded post-doc position to take a position that only offered 45K. I would recommend to all considering applying to understand the salary limiations for a smaller college and accept this as a given. If you are committed to teaching with limited research, it seems like a nice place with tons of potential.  12) @7 Regarding recruitment events: I work at Appalachian State, a Comprehensive University of 20K that is just down the road from LMC, and all faculty at my university take turns participating in recruitment/open house. Students want to meet with the faculty they will be working with, and service is part of our contract. I am confused why anyone thinks that they wouldn't be asked to do this at a small liberal arts college?  ""High"" teaching loads of 4:4 are the norm at a small liberal arts college, as well. You would have this at LMC or even at a prestigious institution like Elon (I have two grad school friends that teach there.) Anything above 12 contact hours (4 courses), you would have to be compensated for an overload. The only way you would have less than a 4:4 is by having release for research, which only happens at larger institutions. At App State, we teach a 3:3 load because we have a one course research release, but that comes with expectations of scholarly products (peer reviewed publications and NSF grant applications). Liberal Arts colleges are focused on teaching, not research. Re: salaries at LMC, most small colleges have low salaries for sure, and all of the schools in the region (App State included) are dealing with increased cost of living (albeit responding slowly). The price of homes has doubled in the last three years, as with many areas around the country. I doubt this situation will last forever. If offered a job, perhaps ask for temporary housing as part of negotiation? Most faculty have never lived right in Banner Elk (for LMC) or Boone (for App State). More reasonable homes are 15-20 minutes away from either campus. As an ecologist, I also consider that I have my field sites right in my back yard! I used to do my work in Colorado, but I save thousands by not having to travel every summer. 13) @12 A 4:4 load is not the ""norm"" at a liberal arts college. To be fair, the range is from 2:2 to 4:4, and I'd guess that a 3:3 is fairly common as well (I have a 2:2 load prior to research releases at a school of <3000 students). 14) [Search Chair]: I hope that I can clear up some the confusion and derisive statements provided by @ 7. This individual started at LMC at the same time I did, however I experienced my time here very differently than they did and a lot of progress has occurred in the year since they left. Salaries hare still low relative to the cost of housing, but the administration has acknowledged this real problem and made steps to address this. For example, we are transitioning to a higher pay scale across the college and I just received a significant raise. The college has also pledged to develop faculty housing, but we could really use it right now. @7’s comment “the college would otherwise have an amazing potential, but it is run like a pyramid scheme and I doubt degrees from the college mean anything but that the student could afford to go there”. Well they got the first part right, but the last part of this statement undermines their credibility and makes clear their level of personal animosity and desire to damage our ongoing search. The Wildlife program does have tremendous potential and in my time here I have seen so much growth and progress toward this end. This year the campus expanded to include an additional 500 acres, two thirds of which is designated for conservation protection of forest, fields, wetlands, and riparian habitats. We just need more dedicated faculty that are passionate about teaching and mentoring students to become wildlife professionals. We recently hired a wonderful new avian ecologist and a second outstanding wildlife veterinarian. This current ecologist position represents a new line given to us in recognition of our continued growth in student enrollment in wildlife. The administration recognizes the importance of the Wildlife Program and they are investing in us. I am fully transparent about the limitations here and potential of this program and I will gladdly discuss this position with any interested candidates. You can reach me at osbournm@lmc.edu. 15) Wow, Search Chair, good on you! You're doing a tremendous service in being so forthcoming on this board. Seems like there is an axe to grind from others. Best of luck with this search (from a NC native without any real connection to LMC). 16) If the administration has made steps to address the salary issue, what was the adjustment? What's the salary for this position? I'm not piling on this university, but administrators love to talk about progress when they're falling further and further behind on issues like salary. 17] @16, this is #4 [a comittee member] we don't consider it piling on...the salary range discussed by #7 is ~ 133% higher at the present time--the individual is just disgruntled...the sub-optimal salary situation is widespread problem at liberal arts institutions--it's certainly frustrating but not unique to Lees-McRae.  You are certainly correct that administrators often fail to reognize that money is a massively importmant consideration (that is not unique to LMC) however that being said, we encourage you and any other ecologist to give us a look. Thanks.

(2) Is there a language requirement? (3) is this really a tenure track position or do you lose employment after the 3+3 years as is typical in Germany? (4) what constitutes young?  Isn't this an agist statement? Yes! (5) As someone who was a somewhat non-traditional PhD student, I take great offense to statements of ""young"". I hope I am still considered a currently effective and promising future researcher regardless of my age! From ad: ""Active time in academia will be considered in the evaluation process."" Even if it is not explicitly age-related, I can't stand these types of restrictions. I guess it comes down to eligibility for grants? 5) As someone that didn't get a similar position because I was ""too old"", this is usually related to limits established by ERC grants. A ""young"" researcher is <6-7 years post-PhD. 6) Realize that in Germany and in much of Europe that ageism is ok. I had a grant proposal rejected once because even though they saw the merits and found nothing wrong with the proposal, for my age I didn't have enough papers, but this is something never put in the program description, you only find out after you apply and get the written reviews back.  There is generally an expectation of a linear trajectory in one's career, one starts early, say in the first year of their university studies, and then move quickly on to a Phd, then a postdoc and then a junior prof. It's a system that maximizes performance of young people, who if by the time have not secured a permanent positoin after the junior prof position, often are legally banned from taking up a science position in Germany and have to leave the country.

So it doesn't really affect us. We do have a great and cohesive long-term eco/evo department and community, and the principal gets replaced every 6 years or so. [Many of us are frustrated about the UK's ""marketisation of higher education"" - somewhat following the footsteps of the US. That the  aforementioned article exists and makes headlines highlights that UK higher education is strongly unionised, and that UK unions still do have power & a voice]. 4) I recommend contacting head of department as suggested in job advertisement.

I wonder if more junior precarious staff at QMU would have the same attitude. Yes the UCU is doing well at the moment, but that doesn't hide the fact that QMU was/is doing it's best to intimidate its members. The point here is if you are a competitive candidate then go somewhere else because this university does not care about it's staff. Just as an aside point because I see this a lot on this sheet when the wider behaviour of the university is criticised  ""the department is supportive/good/strong..."" sure but it's important to remember that you don't work for the 'department' you work for the university. Yes a strong dept head can shield you to some extent from bad management, but not always.X2 8) I agree with much of what you say. 7. In many universities, parts of ""central management"" is at odds with staff. However it is worth putting things into a general UK perspective. And in that view, QMUL and in particular QM biology is on good footing - with a great overall dynamic & cash flowing, an ability to expand, and good support for much of what matters from the central powers in the university. (You mention precarious staff - we have very few short-term contracts in QM Biology (unless you count postdocs & phd students who do some TA-ing) - and I'm not that old!). 9) New deadline seems to be 4 April 2023. 10) Newer deadline looks like 17 April 2023","","International",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

They want someone with expertise in ecology, organismal biology, integrative animal taxonomy and phylogenetics, or conservation biology.  But in very next paragraph they say the successful candidate will have expertise in areas that are relevant to human health, such as clinical biology, microbiology, immunology, physiology, or toxicology. Applicants that incorporate computational biology would be welcomed. I contacted the chair some time ago and was told they would review the pool end of week 1 february.   I thought, in fact swear I personally posted this last fall.   2) Based on another job on their site (https://uasys.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/UASYS/job/Little-Rock/Assistant-Professor---9-MONTH_R0028670), maybe the second paragraph was included by mistake?  1) That is what I thought, then I talked with someone. It is clear as mud. 3) It really doesn't matter as the selection committee should have already sent recommendations for phone interviews to the Dean by now. 4) So... don't waste time applying now if this is your first time seeing this post? 5) Well, I 'wasted' my time and applied anyway and was invited for a Zoom interview. Sounds like some disinfo here.  6) @5 no, this isn't disinfo. Then again, the number of times I've seen people claim they got an interview only to learn the school had not even started reviewing applications is pretty high.  When was your zoom interview?  7) @6 I'm not 5, but on Monday I received an invitation from an admin in the Bio Dept to schedule a Zoom interview with options over the next couple of weeks. Mine hasn't been scheduled yet. x3 6) THANKS!!! ;)  good luck! 8) the email sounds like they will notify us regarding the time on the day of the interview! So prepare yourself every day, just like you would the Spanish Inquisition. 9) I emailed yesterday to check in on whether they'd scheduled - they told me my time and sounded like interview times were generally going out on Monday/the 6th. 10) Same - interview scheduled - good luck to everyone else with interviews! 9) @10 did you get an email with a calendar invite/zoom link? I haven't heard back since I bothered them last week. 10) Yes, I got an email with a calendar invite and zoom link. Hope you hear back! They seem like a wonderful department. 10) @9 I did get the link and have to agree, they were great! Best of luck to you! 11) invite for in-person 3/16 12) Was the invite for the molecular position or the ecology/evolution? 13) This is a little surprising since I was told in the Zoom interview that they'd likely have a short list for campus invitations by the end of March with interviews taking place well into April and maybe early May. 11) @12 Ecology position, but my interviewers were all molecular folks (still don't know what to think of that). @13, I received 6 options for in-person dates from late March (next week) into first week of May 12) Are they organizing your visit or is it up to you? 11) @12 Only told what day my research presentation would be, and that there is no chalk talk. They booked a flight for me. Other than that I just assumed I would get an itinerary close to my visit - I never considered they wouldn't organize my visit but now I'm wondering. Are you asking for a specific reason or just out of curiosity? 13) Offered 5/9 but declined. Salary was not negotiable and not competitive for the region and institution type. 14) @13 Thanks for the update, but sorry it didn't work out for you. 15) Was this offered to anybody else? 16) 13 here. I was told during my interview in early May that there was another interview scheduled at the end of this month and was therefore surprised that I got an offer so quickly (that I turned down). It's a mystery. 15) Thanks again for your insight, 13. 15) Offered 6/2. Declined/negotiations failed 6/5 because the deans understandably rejected a year delay on start date 16) it sounds like their administration needs to realize they need to offer something better. 17 Why 'understandably'? 15) I guess I felt they probably feel like they need to fill the position sooner or they'd rather fail it and try again. Maybe they think I'd try to look for something else in the meantime and then they'd have to search again in two years rather than one. No idea really - mostly contriving scenarios where I could understand why they'd deny delaying. They were fine delaying to January. 16) I do agree that delaying an entire year might be a big issue. January is more reasonable, but an an entire year, from there point, anything could happen. Sorry to hear that this didn't work out for you. 17) official rejection received 6/16 15 again) Also received notification ""your application is no longer under consideration"" on 6/14. Was this offered to anybody else or did the search just fail? 17) did anyone get reimbursed for the expenses? I was told they'd pay, I gave them receipts and then nothing. 18) When I was there booking a car to get home because my return flight was canceled, office staff told me it would take a few months.

In particular, PA has a number of current and potential invasive species threats and extension gives advice and training on how to deal with them. I pointed out the split in part because I know there are plenty of people not familiar with what extension is - don't feel dumb #2! - and a statement about extension is required for the application. 5) As someone who was previously at Penn State, Extension is very important there. As with a teaching statement, you definitely don't want to be like ""Never done this, but would be interested to learn!"" You also shouldn't simply be pitching that you will run a display table at a public outreach event, because that's not what this is. Say you were the Extension person for fruit crops at Penn State, you would be the go-to resource on this for the entire state and would be expected to communicate recommendations to growers through Extension articles etc. Part of your research program would usually include trials of pesticides or other management practices, which you could communicate the results of to growers each year. Do not get this confused with standard outreach...the Extension faculty I knew did a TON of work on the Extension side and would often be expected to drive to any point in the state and back in a day, to give an on-farm presentation, meet with farmers, and similar. You could certainly apply without previous Extension experience, but inform yourself really well and show how you would create an integrated Research-Extension program. 6) Extension will eat you lunch then take your dinner.  Its incredibly busy, extremely time consuming, and you better have a very high energy level. 7) Would this position consider candidates with marine biology backgrounds? Dealing with invasive species in marine/ saltwater systems? 8) TT professor with extension responsibilities here and same split-- commenter 5 is wrong about extension, you can freely say yes or no to events-- with invasive species being the theme and no direct commodity responsibility, there is actually a lot of flexibility for extension.  6) That depends on where you work.  It also depends on who the current extension director is.  If you are skipping out of events too much, aloha baby. 9) To answer 5)- checked with the department and they encourage people with marine system backgrounds to apply. 10) As Head of the department this position will be housed in, I can clarify expectations for the extension portion of this position. Simply put ... develop an applied research program that helps the state of PA with invasive species problems and then connect with stakeholders in the state who will benefit from the work. Which invasive species, which stakeholders, and which types of extension programs is up to you. 11) any updates? 12) none here. I emailed the chair to ask a couple questions about the position and never received a response. I also never received anything about my application except from the admin person saying she got the documents. Not a great first impression.... 13) They are running in-person interviews now.","5","Pennsylvania State University-Main Campus",TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I think what the department member means is that, in as far as PUIs go, Colgate has funds and support for VAPs to conduct research with undergraduates, should they want to do so. Many other PUIs don’t have those options. But to be clear, you HAVE TO WANT TO WORK WITH UNDERGRADUATES @4, if you do not, this is not a good option for you.

Ideally we would love to hire someone comfortable teaching both our Ecology course Fall 2023 (covering Organismal, Behavioral, and Population ecology) and Biodiversity course Spring 2025 (covering Community, Ecosystem, and Landscape ecology). VAPs typically teach a 5-course load each year: 1-2 sections of ""thematic"" Intro Bio (~30 students) , a lecture + lab course (counts as two courses), and possibly an elective class or mentoring senior thesis research. While research is not explicitly part of the job, there are some resources available for folks to continue their research as a VAP (lab space, greenhouse space, campus natural areas, basic field supplies).

Anyone have a sense if it is reasonable given cost of living? 1) by the area I assume you mean New England/Northeast? VT is definitely less expensive than MA and parts of NH, especially if you are ok with going outside Burlington to live. I think the bigger problem is the schools fiscal health, it is a small school that isn't well supported with state funding so salaries are low. The upside is you get to live in VT. 2) where did someone come up with low 70Ks? I don't see that anywhere in the ad 3) in what world is UVM ""a small school""? 3) Small for an R1 4) @2 Probably from publicly available salaries listed online 5) @3 UVM is not an R1 6) This position is very broad. 7) any news? 8) no as of 23-Feb 9) it was posted to the Texas A&M job board on Feb 19 (4 days after the indicated review date on the UVM job page), and the TA&M posting lists a different, later review date of March 1 - the review date in the original posting is not updated. Not sure if this necessarily means anything? 10) no news as of March 6 x2; 11) No news March 14 x4 12) Another cancelled search?? 1 month is a long time to review...  13) They're on spring break so maybe there will be news next week 14) 1 month is not a long time to review, necesarily (especially with spring break). Factor in the fact that everyone is busier and more burnt out right now (we're still in a pandemic, after all, and childcare disruptions in particular are common). It takes weeks to review what can be hundreds of applicants, and then you have to meet to discuss them, and there's usually an HR step for a first pass/approval of Zoom interviees. Nothing weird here at all. 15) Why does ""nothing weird here at all"" make me think there is definitely something weird here? 16) My thoughts exactly. I'm always suspicious when someone says ""nothing weird here"" is going on; either they are defending the situation (but why?) or they don't know (so why assume something weird isn't happening)? And for the record, in my experience the average review time between review date and invites is 2 weeks (3 tops), and we are approaching 6 weeks. 17) must have been a faild search. 18) I got a rejection email and also the search has not failed 19) No rejection email here (or any communication) as of March 31 2023 at 3:30pm PDT. Looks like this will be yet another search committee that lets a select few know either way and the rest are left to question why the committee couldn't be bothered to send an email. 20) received zoom interview request 4/3 x2 21) ""Nothing weird here at all"" means that in my experience at similar institutions, such timelines are not uncommon at all, especially in spring. I wasn't ""defending"" the situation, I was providing context that one month to review applications and find a time for a busy search committee to meet is not unusual or strange or evidence of some kind of conspiracy. I look forward to you all reviewing hundreds of applications with care and attention in two weeks when you have jobs one day. 22) Rejection email from HR 4/25","14","University of Vermont",FALSE,"VT",231174,"Burlington","R2 Doctoral Universities: High Research Activity","Balanced arts & sciences/professions, some graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: STEM-dominant","Four-year, full-time, more selective, lower transfer-in","High undergraduate","Four-year, large, highly residential","Classified","New England CT ME MA NH RI VT","Public, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Public",1,"City Small","Yes","Yes","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,2447,474,51,181,0,3153,178828,12319,76,572,7,0,33,11,40,11,204,451,1140,1307,0,0,13548,15903,13292,12326,11136,2156,10198,387,37,514,1608,548,2465,22,291,18,NA,NA,25,51,NA,494,0.156676,70,61,32,0.457143,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",1,0,0,18,8,5872,1959,745,590,570,1160,26,24,24.551036,18569,13244,0.713232,3

Plus, the same people complaining about internal hires would complain if they were the internal candidate and the institution hired ""some unknown"" from outside. At most institutions, especially in tight budget years, if a professor leaves or retires, the department is given a NTT line for a year while they try to get approval for a full search. So, of course there is a NTT faculty member with the same expertise as the job ad. Unless it is a new program, who else do you think is currently teaching the classes / doing the job that the department is looking to fill on a long-term basis? On average, the person who takes a VAP/adjunct position in spring/summer (in searches that are not typically very competitive) is not going to magically be the most qualified candidate for an international search the following September (when most TT jobs advertise) - they often haven't even started the 1yr job yet when the TT ad gets posted, so the idea that the TT ads are often written around the expertise of an internal candidate who has barely even started working in the department is laughable. There are of course exceptions, but don't assume that its a sham search just because they have a NTT faculty member currently in that role. 2) If you'd like ot work there apply...3) Looking at the NTT faculty lab webpage, he is already advertising for PhD students in the fall 2023 and spring 2024 semesters, not something a NTT lecturer can do. 4) Definitely feels like an internal hire given @3's comment and the specificity of the posting x5. 5) preordained Internal hires only happen if a spouse is involved. Being an internal candidate who is qualified for the position is both an advantage and disadvantage because they know you.  You can show off your sparkles, but you can't hide your warts in that situation.  So, an interviewee will be fresh, warts hidden.

It sounds similar. @1 - Yes children and families can live on Sapelo at the housing (a house is provided with very reduced rent). @2 This job is primarily administrative with teaching as well. The person works closely with the director of the marine institute, plans, advertises and executes a spring semester for UGA students , and teaches an intensive field course in the summer. @3 This is the same job that was advertised last year. (4) Wasn't that job accepted last year? 5) @4 yes but the person left for another position (6) Is there any potential to publish research in this position? 7) @6 from my understanding you will have lab space and some funds, but with only 10% of your time dedicated to research, its very much not the priority.

Are you expected to be a super postdoc or you become one once you get a position? 3) I think that 1 means that this is the European system in which you work as a junior group leader under a senior prof, and slowly build your lab and group up over time. 4) No, this is a tenure-track assistant prof position. First located at the SciLifeLab and then after tenure (associate prof) you'd move to the main campus in the Zoology Dept. While at the SciLifeLab the lab gets lots of funding from the program, however once you get to Zoology that's done. In that sense, you're a super-funded early career researcher.

They typically pay the visa fee but it's the applicant's responsibility to pay the NHS surcharge (~£3,000) 4) Is that charge mandatory? Seems like it would be a deal-breaker for almost anyone. How many ECRs have £3,000 laying around? 5) I just found that Bath offers interest-free loans to help with that and other fees https://www.bath.ac.uk/guides/interest-free-loan-scheme-for-home-office-application-fees-and-related-legal-costs/ 6) You can try to negotiate to have both the application fee and surcharge covered when you're offered the position. My uni ended up reimbursing the surcharge cost- it is a mandatory part of the visa application process (seems expensive but you do receive free healthcare and prescriptions in the UK). You also have to pay it a second time at the 5 year mark when you apply for indefinite leave to remain (permanent residency). The UK has the most expensive visa system in the world. Manageable if it's just you, but very unaffordable for a family. 6) So this means is a 6,000 cost when traveling with the spouse? 8) Keep in mind that Bath also isn't cheap. 9) ""1 referee must be your present or previous employer"". I have an independent position (no PI), so does that mean my dept chair?

My best guess is they are looking for someone who is a good teacher for a breadth of different biology courses and they are open to many different types of research so long as it's a good fit for undergraduates. I had an in-person interview there previously and got great vibes from the place (happy colleagues, happy students).  I encourage everyone to apply! 5) Anyone know what the pay is?

Most US-based schools do not hire people unless they have English proficiency. It is what it is and there is no actual reason to complain about French language requirements. x7 4) Worth noting that residency in Quebec for non-Canadians now requires B2 level French so if you've not got your Canadian PR yet and don't speak French it'll be a long haul. 5) This job and Quebec immigration will require learning French, but candidates don't need to be fluent at time of hiring. But yes it does take a sincere commitment to learn in the timeframe of obtaining tenure and residency (4-5 years). 6) How does it work for non-French speaking SOs? 3) @6 Are you asking what opportunities there are for SOs in Montreal if they don't speak French?  It's a highly bilingual city and there are many jobs for people who only speak English. There are English CEGEPs if that's of interest. You'll have way more options if you eventually learn French, but there are multiple English universities and schools and the whole West Island is predominantly English speaking. @3 (6 again) In part, and that's very helpful to know. The other part is more immigration, if residency in Quebec requires fluency (not that they'd be unwilling to learn, but as has been pointed out, it's a long haul) 3) The degree of French fluency required of a partner is less than what is required of someone applying as a skilled worker: https://www.quebec.ca/en/immigration/immigration-programs/quebec-experience-program/selection-conditions/knowledge-french 4) Mtl academic here: my non-French speaking SO did struggle to find employment in Quebec and had to learn French.

(7) prev comment really disingenous; more than two faculty left, and it wasn't because of family; faculty get very little support from adminstration, dei efforts have been absent or performative (though this might be changing); ineffective administration and leadership that is indifferent to toxic culture; dept has a serious lack of self awareness about these issues x2 (8) They pay their TAs very low wages and students are less and less willing to apply to the program. Faculty are having trouble recruiting students.\ (9) I currently am at UH Manoa and went to grad school there. There are issues that seem to be driving good research focused professors away across several departments - upper management related; they do pay the grad students very poorly, and I knew students who lived in the cars while in grad school becuase they could not pay for housing. This has been an issues for years at UH Manoa. However, students keep coming becuase they want to live in Hawaii. I would say that seems to be the problem actually - people think they want to live in Hawaii, but its not all beautiful and paradise and most people who move to Hawaii leave within 2 years. UH search committees tend to hire folks that are not familar with island life and all its wonders and issues, and they don't hire their graduates who have established relationships with the local community. And they shot themselves in the foot a bit by doing that. Its not going to be a research school at the same level as schools on the mainland becuase we are cut off - we cannot support as much instrumentation for example because there are just not enough users. You cannot import materials as easy here, becuase of regulations meant to protect the Hawaiian Islands. And we have limited resources that everyone is trying to carve up and sometimes fight over. (10) I'm faculty at UHM and I like it. (11) I'm RZF and I can be reached at roszenil@uky.edu, I have posted in general discussion since some comments here are speculating why I left UHM. (12) I'm also faculty at UHM and I like my job. Some wacky stuff here. I've never heard of a student (with an advisor in Life Sciences) living in their car. Like many academic institutions, we tend not to hire our own PhDs, for many good reasons. For a very small state we do just fine with research (https://www.hawaii.edu/news/2022/08/16/academic-ranking-of-world-universities/), TYVM. Our teaching assistantships need to be much higher, but most productive faculty have grants and pay their students decent salaries. (13) It's hard to take a rant like that from 9 seriously, with so many spelling and grammatical errors. (14) I have worked at a place very similar to UHM and what 9 says rings true there as well. Discrediting their real perspectives over the excessively dismissive ones made here by some apparent UH faculty is the kind of energy that probably contributes to folks leaving. Touting rankings of research output as a signal of a healthy workplace doesn't help, I might add. x3 (15) The School of Life Sciences is part of the R1 university; as such it expects new faculty to be productive at research with grant money and publications. Those that are do well. Also, UH is on an island 2500 miles from the mainland. Some people can't handle that. When I arrived at UH, people said we would be there for 5 years or forever. We stayed and love it. Also, Honolulu is a very diverse city. If you are a white or black person you will be in a distinct minority (17 and 6%, respectively). In many ways this is like living in a foreign country. Some people love that, some can't deal with it. Lastly, yes there is DEI things happening, but what I said at the beginning still applies, or should. (16) @12 housing insecurity is not something one loudy and proudly proclaims, it is a deeply personal experience, and it definitely happens to students at UH. x3 (17) @13 I hope you're not applying for positions that require any teaching X3 (18)@12 - I wrote 9. The students who lived in their car were in Botany or Zoology in the EECB program (which is now Life Sciences) - was not the advisor's doing, its the very poor salary to grad students. Its been an issue for years here - ask about what Gordon Tribble did with food stamps over in SOEST many years ago. Faculty from SOEST and CNS have been leaving due to upper management decisions, and its worth asking about what those issues are if you are selected.  I was not ranting@13 -  I love UHM and currently work here. I love Hawaii. But it is not for everyone, and there are differences and potential limiations to your career here that you should think about, and the reason so many people leave that move here within the first couple of years (in general in Hawaii its about 70% of the folks who move here). As others are saying, island life is not for everyone, so its worth asking about these issues and giving it a serious think. :) 18) anyone else really struggling with their app software, it added 39 things under my education from my CV and I had to delete every single one 19) @18 SC member here - can you explain a little more?

Dept does not get to choose website for applications. 20) @19 I'm not #18 but it seems the software that automatically reads the CV file is a bit overeager in interpreting different lines on the CV as new degrees/positions, so it automatically generates many entries and makes your applicants look extremely educated! Other than that the UHM application portal was one of the better ones I've used. 21) Candidate only ready selected. A colleague got an email stipulating this a week after the ad closed. 22) @21 what does 'candidate only ready selected mean' I havn't heard that term before! xD @21-22, check job ID # on the ""we selected a candidate"" letter, I received a letter like this few days ago and it was from SOEST (not School of life Sciences/CNS) and job ID was for different UH job posting to in oceanography. I doubt this position has moved to letter requests at this stage.@21-22 Candidate only ready selected? what does mean, do you move or not? or what is that? LOL mine says under review. 23) I am #22, sorry to confuse, I was asking what 21 meant by 'candidate ready selected' I don't know what this term means either - how do you check if your application is under review? @23) no worries! it is just that i dont know what candidate ready selected would mean. I cant figure out if that means you are selected to continue or excluded. haha anyway, you can log into your candidate profile (it is the same link, look up right) and check the application status. In my experience it only updates for those that move forward if any action is required from the candidate. But... also I am waiting to hear if I go on campus interview from a couple places and just says under review. 24) the ""candidate only ready selected"" from @21 is pretty clearly a typo, should be ""already selected"", and this is certainly not in relation to this job post but another UH job where a hire was made. 25) @24 - thanks for the clarification! 26) letters requested 1/20 27) were letter requests sent to applicant or directly to referees? 28) to referees 29) Received request for zoom interview 2/14 x2 30) request for in person interview 03/10/23","12","University of Hawaii at Manoa",FALSE,"HI",141574,"Honolulu","R1 Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity","Balanced arts & sciences/professions, high graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Comprehensive programs, with medical/veterinary school","Four-year, full-time, selective, higher transfer-in","High undergraduate","Four-year, large, primarily residential","Not Classified","Far West AK CA HI NV OR WA","Public, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Public",1,"City Large","Yes","Yes","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,3109,952,198,206,0,4465,273320,2609,244,1015,33,32,84,49,149,49,313,845,1405,1704,0,54,17490,20702,18025,14936.333333,13203,4822,10581,2283,107,232,2704,2118,2039,145,1181,454,NA,NA,28,52,NA,808,0.180963,76,128,52,0.684211,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,1,25,21,3272,979,696,540,530,1070,21,21,21,13240,11081,0.836934,2

We know most PhD students or PDFs won't have these, esp. international applicants. In these cases a teaching statement is usually sufficient. -- From Full Prof in this dept, on many recent searches, but not this one. (2) Letter requests go out after applying. Not sure if automated or after preliminary screening. (3) Instructions say it is automatic. (4) "" strong endorsements from referees of high standing"" is a huge red flag, isn't it? (5) Why's that? (6) How should I interpret this statement: ""All qualified candidates are encouraged to apply; however, Canadians and permanent residents will be given priority."" (7) That's a Canada-wide policy. (8) It says to upload 3 pubs but I couldn't upload one of my favorite ones because it exceeded the file size limit. Had to go with a less favorite one instead. (8) I had the issue of a too-large PDF and compressed the file so it could upload. (9) Any idea if organismal includes bacteria, or is the implication that it does not? (10) Organismal includes all organisms, but is meant to capture having some real knowledge of the biology, natural history, etc of a group of organisms. i.e., knowing E coli really well does not count, but knowing lots of microbes might. -- Full Prof. (11) Find a way to get us your best pubs. Don't let the website, designed by an IT contractor, dictate your application. (12) Canadian immigration law and work permit statutes require #6 in job ads. No way around it. If you're interested, apply. Many of our faculty are not Canadian. 13) @11, great, thanks for the help.. rolling my eyes. 14) Citizenship matters less than your connections to certain senior UBC profs 15) @ 14), do you mean senior UT profs, or am I missing something here? (16) UBC and UofT hire a lot of one another's graduates, and @14 is referencing that fact somewhat cynically. 17) this thread seems pretty toxic :/ (18) ah, i see, thank you @16. (19) its not toxc to point out that UBC practically runs the show up in Canada, which is what @14 is saying. it is what it is, and people should apply with their eyes open (20) Can anyone from the department speak to the culture in EEB? Some very divisive opinions out there... (21) @9 @10 the ad says _organism_ or group of organisms, so I think even if you focus on a single organism if there's a strong natural history component of your work, it seems in bounds (22) @14, UBC is a big EEB department in Canada and a lot of great people come out of there, so there probably is a network effect, but UBC trainees are not particularly over-represented among assistant profs at U of T , recent hires come from a bunch of different programs 23) Ok this is kinda dumb, but I'm not really clear on what ""a deep natural history knowldege of an organism"" (singular) really entails? Knowledge of its evolutionary history? Life-history? Ecological role? All of the above? 24) Not speaking from any particular knowledge about this search or call but it probably references having a system rather than being a methods-type biologist who is system-agnostic? 25) @23 sorry to be blunt, but if you're asking this you're probably not a good fit fot the position 26) Autecology i.e. physiological ecology-type studies where you will focus on a single species or small group of related organisms is usually what ""organismal ecologist"" tends to mean. Not populations, communities, or ecosystems. 27) Wondering if the identity of the search committee chair gives a clue about whom they are looking for ""Organismal Ecology and/or Evolution""? 28) @25 notice you didn't give your expert definition. Do you feel better about yourself after writing that helpful comment? Thanks to 24 & 26 for their thoughts! 29) Based on the language in the ad, I would interpret this as a really broad search, along the lines of @24. I think if they specifically wanted someone working at a particular scale (e.g. physiology) they'd mention that in the ad to save time sifting through apps! 30) Disagree with the previous comment. I think they would have just said ""ecology"" or ""evolution"" if they were open to community & ecosystem ecologists. 31) Whether its written as a broad search or not, you should still apply. Apply. To. Everything. 32) The EEB department is great, not biased at all, but in all honesty, everyone is super friendly and open to collab. 33) Do not Apply. To. Everything. Apply where you think you will be a good fit, and where you think you will be happy, apply to everything leads to a lot of noise and wasted time for applicants, committees, reference letter writers, it's not worth it, the pay is bad, the academic system is toxic, what's the whole point. 34) my interpret 35) lol at ""the EEB dept is great..."" a recent review found a huge amount of race & gender based harassment, competitiveness, toxicity etc. within the dept (to be fair probably not at all unique to this dept or school, and at least there are ongoing targeted efforts to improve things) - a former PhD student 36) Just a heads up that the automated letter requests trickled out slowly to my referees over the 24+ hours following my application submission...so leave plenty of time before the deadline... 37) yup that was super weird re the emails to the referees. Why?! (38) @35 I am a former graduate student in the dept as well. I think a lot of this had to do with a couple of ""keystone individuals"" who are now gone/retired. Recent hires indicate that the dept is moving in an extremely positive direction. 39) change has already ""Start""'-ed there, huh @38? 40) Does anyone have insight into how these different campuses work? I expected the campuses to operate as their own institutions, but I see that the department lists faculty across all campuses. (38 again) Graduate program is united across campus, undergraduate programs separate (though all degrees say 'U Toronto'). Less connection between campuses than you'd think. I only went once to UTM and never to UTSC. 41) @40 faculty members are sometimes the committees of grads from other campuses, but all undergrad teaching is on their home campus. Really nice to have a broader group of faculty for student committees, but making connections takes a bit of effort because there's generally not a lot of movement between campuses. 42) Do complete ref letters need to be submitted by Jan 4th? Or just the other application materials + requests for letters? I'm applying pretty late (Dec 28th), don't want to waste my time if the letters need to be sent within a week. 43) My read on it was that the letters need to be in by the 4th. x4 44) Bummer. I really wish academic jobs would not require letters of rec up front. Wrangling my letter writers to get anything submitted for a dealine is hell. 44) This deadline was particularly difficult - right after the holidays when folks may still be away or are inundated with work because they just got back... I got my letters in but it took a lot of emailing my writers while they were on break 45) @44 I wonder if that explains the relatively low ""number applied"" 46) the language concerning preferential hiring of Canadian applicants doesn't help. 47) sure @46, but other Canadian positions (for which the same applies) have had similar or greater numbers applied even with more narrow job focuses 48) yes @47 but the combination of timing, letters up front, and Canadian preference adds up. CDN positions seem to score about half the applications of US equivalents, compare UBC's search with equivalent searches in the US. But agreed this is surprisingly low...good for those of us who did apply I suppose. (49) The majority of recent hires at UBC are Ivy-league educated Americans. (at ECR stage) 50) yes @49 but there are people who will see that language and decide it is not worth applying, regardless of whether it is. Combined with letters up front over the holiday break and I can see a lot of people deciding this isn't worth bothering their referees over. 51) Anyone hear anything about this job yet? 52) Nope (26 Jan) x2 53) Postdoc at UofT here. The seminar schedule for the semester just got sent out with time held on Mondays and Thursdays for the job talks, but no specific dates or names yet. 54) Thank you @53! 55) Thank you 53 - can you tell us what dates those job talks are set for? That might give hints as to the timeframe they'll use to notify the short-list - assuming they haven't already. 56) The slot on the seminar list is set in between a Feb 10 seminar and March 1 seminar, so potentially in that period? Though specific dates not posted yet, says dates TBD. 57) Thanks! 58) Still nothing here as of 2-3. X5 59) Some hits on my website from U of T on 2/3 (could mean nothing). 60) How can you tell if website hits are from a specific institution? I can see only see Country/City in Google Analytics...thanks! 61) 2/6 and still no word. 62) @60 StatCounter gives pretty precise info. 63) The suspense here is killing me... x3. (64) I am hearing through the grapevine that a seminar schedule was sent out in-department. Can someone at UofT confirm so we can stop watching this space? (65) Not true x2 66) Can also confirm that I haven't received any seminar schedule (in department)"" (67) 2-24....any update? (68) Unclear if a list of candidates has been made yet, but department sent out a seminar schedule that included tentative slots for interview talks beginning in mid-march. No candidate names were in the schedule.  (70) I'd be surprised if nobody on this list got an invite. Suspect to hear any day. (71) Invitation for in-person interview received on Feb 28th. 72) Congrats @71! 73) U of T postdoc here. Seminar schedule just went out with abstracts for the 5 job talks. Looks like there is a strong focus on macroevolution/speciation type research for this search. 74) @73, thank you for updating, it's always nice to have a bit more info (and a comforting story to tell one's self about reasons for not being selected...)x2 (75) Offer has been made 76) Rejection email receivedx2","21","International",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Research should connect organismal biology to global change issues, and may integrate multiple biological, spatial, and/or temporal scales"". Seems like a revival of a search that was cancelled during COVID. 2) The previous search was cancelled and swept due to COVID. This is a new position, but the goals of the hiring unit are still the same, hence the similar wording. 3) As someone who applied and whose letters were requested in the pre-pandemic search, received email from SC reminding of the search. Not sure if it went to all applicants or those they were further interested in - I think it got cancelled at the point I was at. 4) Also got that email (or at least an email from the SC), but did not have letters requested during the pre-pandemic search. x3 5) It was strange in re-pandemic call, but now even more so... why no DEI statement? Do they not care about DEI the way nearly all other universities do in their job materials? 6) @5 job ad asks candidates to address ""approach and commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion..directlly into research and teaching statements"". 7) @6 click link, scroll down, no diversity statement as part of application materials (most apps require 1-2 pages to address this). If buried in the portal for application materials, ok, but still— no statement. Integrating into your teaching statement is not equivalent. 8) From the direct link: ""Content addressing the candidate’s approach and commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion should be directly incorporated into the research and teaching statements."" They're not asking for it just in the Teaching as you suggest, they want it incorporated in both the teaching and research statement. Research and teaching are the biggest component of a faculty position, telling them how you are incorporating DEI into those activities is a better way to evaluate candidates than the cookie cutter statement telling them that DEI is important, that you read a book about it, that you went to a workshop, etc. An overall better approach to gauge actual commitment x2.  9) Arguably integrating DEI into diversity and teaching statement is better and more revealing than a separate statement, as it can show that your commitment to DEI pervades all aspects of your scholarly activities, rather than being a separate statement you to just check a box. 10) anyone heard anything? 11) Nothing 15/1 x3 12) I received an email that they've already selected a candidate for this position (15/1) 13) @12 Was this a form email or a response to a query?

Could anyone with experience comment on how this transition might be for applicants that reside in a more liberal country (or american state)? (3) @2 it sounds the indignity of intermingling with poor, ignorant Americans would be too much for you. X2 (4) @3 that's not fair, it's a legit question. x3 @2 I've lived on both coasts and the south, and there are good and bad in both places. Fayetteville and the NWA region as a whole is uniquely diverse. Also note that if granted an interview you'd be able to see the area and decide for yourself if it's worth relocating to. (5) #3 -- the poverty of the US south is not the problem to international applicants, I'd worry about the the racism and xenophobia, especially if they don't share their beliefs. x4 (6) i can't imagine southerners being as discriminatory as these potential international applicants (7) @2 Arkansas native-here, lots of family in the Fayetteville area. Relative to the rest of the state (and much of the southern US), Fayetteville is a progressive place IMO, like a watered-down Asheville, NC. I might guess you will be plesantly surprised by the atmosphere if you were to visit. I wouldn't let this concern prevent an application submission, as others have said you'll have an opportunity visit if you progress in the app process. I'm biased of course, but having lived and grown accustomed to larger cities in the US, I'd still happily consider Fayetteville as a landing place FWIW. 8) Fayttevile is a tiny liberal island in an ocean of Trump country. Not a bad place to live if you can stomach living in Arkansas (I cannot). UAr is ranked among the top 50 conservative colleges in the US, fwiw.

Did almost exclusively stick to university bubble though. @3 this is (2) and that is a really rude and inconsiderate response—you don't know me or my background.

It's a beautiful state and I've met plenty of liberal people who absolutely love living there. And a great state to be a botanist.... x5 (13) It is weird that people don't have any sympathy for minority international applicants asking about living conditions in a state. x5 14) I don't think it was stated that these international applicants were ""minorities"". that being said i think fears of racism are reasonable anywhere in america. many arkansas would be offended at the implicaiton that they are uniquely racist and xenophonic.

This is not approved yet, but it seems likely that it will happen before the new year. Make sure that you ask about this if you get to the finalist stage as the details are important and will indeed likely mean then end of tenure as it currently exists for faculty in Florida. 5) thanks for this info @4, do you have a source where we could read about this? I honestly would like some review of tenured faculty given that many of them are the reason academia sucks in many aspects, but if this post tenure review process involves some political bull that makes it easy for schools to pay people less, then I wouldn't touch that with a ten foot pole. Ok, after googling it this is really concerning in my opinion. I also didn't know about this: ""The survey, required in a bill approved last year, posed questions asking if students felt their professors used their platforms to inject their viewpoint and asked all about their political beliefs."" https://www.tampabay.com/news/education/2022/04/19/desantis-signs-bill-limiting-tenure-at-florida-public-universities/ 6) FYI, this program has hemorrhaged minority assistant professors in recent years,  has one of the lowest stipends for students in any R1 grad program. But I am sure they will ask about your efforts to promote DEI. 7) Faculty here are actively working to improve stipends, unlike many R1 grad programs in the state. 8) I was in the department as a grad student about a decade ago. Ive since been a grad student or postdoc at several ""elite"" instutions. The education, training, and support I got here was the best I've had in my career. That being said, the stipend was a serious serious challenge. 9) I'd say losing tenure and being in an environment where climate change, evolution, gender and other topics  are considered political beliefs rather than concepts with scientific basis, would be a really bad mix. Imagine doing a 5 year post doc over and over again until you retire. Nope. Let Florida wipe out its SUS. 9) @6 I find it very telling that a department at a hispanic-serving institution has maybe one Latinx faculty in the roster only. 10) I did my PhD there, can confirm only 1 non-white profs, very disappointed as a BIPOC member. 11) I wanted to comment on the survey mentioned above. The survey was responded by only 2% of faculty and students, not representative. Besides, they found NOTHING to support the stupid idea that professors are injecting their political viewpoints on students. Yet, FL is a scary state, I lived in South Florida a few years and, as a WOC, never found community. My neighbours never came to say hello despite we all had kids around the same age. 12) what do half of these comments have to do with this position? stop rambling about how your neighbors in Florida didn't say ""hi"" to you or whatever. this is irrelevant. keep your political and cultural opinions to yourself. if you aren't interested in the job amd have nothing relevant to say then stay on Twitter. k (x1) 13) As someone who was considering applying for this position, I found these comments very relevant 14) @12 Wow! you are just unbelievable. Those were some genuine concerns from people who had first-hand experiences of the workplace and the living conditions and very relevant for potential applicants! 15) @12 Agreed with @14 - even as someone from Florida (who moved before grad school), I found this very relevant and helpful and I otherwise would not have thought about checking in to certain things. I will also not be applying to this position, as much as I'd love to end up back there. 16) When I was at UCF there was a large international graduate student contingent in the department and it was a welcoming place. I also had friendly neighbores... That's my anecdote so take it for what it's worth. 15) Well, I am devastated. I could not submit my application, which I have been working on for weeks, due to a an error with the submission site. Now the due date has passed, and the site has closed. Anyone else? Website says ""Thank you for your interest in career opportunities with the University of Central Florida.  We received your application.  Our screening and selection process is currently underway and will continue until a successful candidate is chosen.  Should our review of your qualifications result in a decision to pursue your candidacy, we will contact you in the near future."" but my application status is ""no application submitted"" x2 16) Try the link again. May be working again. 17) Is this position still open? It was posted in HigherEd jobs a couple of days ago and there is no deadline. 18) @17 traditionally I have found that they are just reposts and the committee has already been reviewing/made decisions. If you are intersted, I would recommend you just email the Dept chair or SC. But IMO its usually closed. 19) any word? x6 20) None here (1/25) x4 21) nothing here (1/31) 22) Tenured FL SUS faculty here urging applicants to read the news about the new policies for the SUS (including UCF) and prepare to ask targeted questions about support for inclusion, academic freedom and tenure protections.23) Zoom invites coming in the next week or so. 23) Has anyone heard anything (2/8) 24) No (2/8) x5 24) Random zoom invite late Friday (2/10) night! x4 25) The email says there were 98 applications, 12 were selected for the zoom interview and 4 will be called for the on-campus interviews. 26) Selected candidates will be Zoom interviewed for 25 minutes, and interviews will take place in 1-3 weeks from 2/11. The candidate can choose a time slot for each of the proposed days. 2/27) Got an email from HR asking for letters of rec, but previously had them sent to the search chair as requested. Do you think letter writers be contacted again and need to resubmit? 28) No, HR only wants their contact details. 29) Any updates? 29) Invited for on-campus interview (3/8) 30) Congrats @29!X2 31) On-campus interviews done, offer extended? 32) Offer extended.","10","University of Central Florida",FALSE,"FL",132903,"Orlando","R1 Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity","Balanced arts & sciences/professions, high graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Comprehensive programs, with medical/veterinary school","Four-year, medium full-time , selective, higher transfer-in","High undergraduate","Four-year, large, primarily nonresidential","Classified","Southeast AL AR FL GA KY LA MS NC SC TN VA WV","Public, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Public",1,"Suburb Large","No","Yes","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","Yes","No",371,14400,2576,300,166,0,17813,187788,51555,195,1099,18,5,195,82,218,82,848,1894,6112,8288,0,371,69402,81082,71881,56272.333333,61401,10480,43385,17726,128,162,4955,5525,7624,413,4859,2762,NA,NA,26,51,NA,2972,0.166844,66,102,43,0.651515,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,1,21,14,12277,6196,1847,590,570,1160,25,24,24.229641,47957,21661,0.451675,3

I'm asking because I am very interested in teaching at a school similar to Rhodes but have been unable to get any bites with my applications. 9) @8 I'm not sure for this schoool specifically, but I may have more insight on this after the zoom and I can try to circle back and refine this answer. That said, having some knowledge of smaller bio depts where faculty wear a lot of hats and have a large teaching load (usually), that teaching experience and demonstrated involvment in service, outreach, and productive research are all important. Basically, you need to show that you can do all of it at the same time. And I know that sounds a little silly because all universities basically want this too, but for example an R1 is going to be much less interested in your teaching/service contributions than your research, grants and pubs. I'm just guessing here, but thats my two cents. 10) @9  Thank you for taking the time to provide your thoughts. Best of luck with your interview! Sounds like I need to make my materials look a little bit more well-rounded. 11) @9 again, I'm back after a zoom and I think that teaching experience is definitely a large part of this particular job as I expected. So I would make sure your teaching experience and statement are really solid and that you have clear ways your research and teaching could be tied together.

Thank you so much to the person who updated that submission system. 2) No postdoc is required according to call, but are most people applying with postdocs? Anyone not have one and applying? 3) the way I see it when an ad ""requires"" postdoctoral experience it's more of a suggestion/culling mechanism than an actual requirement, so it's kind of misleading. So maybe here they just decided to avoid that and leave it more open? I'd say if this or any other positions look like a good fit for you even if you don't have postdoc experience, go ahead and apply. (4) Agree with 3, but also @2 don't get discouraged if it doesn't work out. Some places will just discard grad students out of hand. 5) Thank you @3&4!  (6) is this looking for a ""divesity"" candidate? wondering if worth applying (7) Wow, agree with 1. Even with having to change the lengths of all my statements, it was so much easier than filling it all out from scratch. (8) @6 I think they are looking from someone with strengths in DEI, @7 are there length requirements for these statements? 9) Yes, application link has them. Something like 2pg research 1pg teaching and unlimited DEI. 10) does the cover letter have a 1 pg maximum? I can't tell if the cover letter is max 1 page or if the letters of rec are max 1 page based on the text in the job ad: ""cover letter that includes names of three referees who can be contacted for letters (reference letters will only be requested of select candidates; 1 page maximum)"" 11) EDI office has really nice materials, looks like the statement will be an important filter point and that DEI is clearly important to all hiring practices there. Would not be surprised if it goes through their office too. @6 I took the time to improve my DEI statement - trying to be genuine and not just tick boxes, as I think a good statement counts. (12) I've heard from an SC member that DEI is #1 filter for this search.  13) Hi 12.  Do you mean in order of screening steps?  Or more like 70% of people submitted a DEI statement that didn't meet their expectations?  (12 again) @13, DEI is the criterion used to filter applications, before looking at other docs. 14) Makes sense. More and more SC are proceeding this way. 15) At our school they won't allow us to filter on single sections, but a poor DEI statement can definitely move you off the interview list.  At least filtering on DEI should stop them from hiring someone who is awful but has lots of grant money. 16) No news yet 12/27 x14 17) STILL no news 1/7 x14 17) 1/10/23 Letters requested x11 18) @17 to you directly or your references? 19) @18 directly to my references via e-mail 20) Any word??? @20, check 17 21) did y'all get letter requests on the same day (1/10)? or have they been spread out over a couple of days? wondering if there are still more requests going out... 22) 1/18/23 letters requested today. 23) mine were requested 1/10/23 with a due date of 1/20/23 x3 24) Any first-round/zoom interviews offered? 25) No news on first-roun/Zoom 1/26/23 x4 26) This is what is currently happening in the department.

(1) Does anyone have experience with this program? 2) I applied last year and made it to on campus interview stage but was told by the dean in my interview I was too far along in my career for the program (I was in my second year as Asst. Prof at a small school, for reference). They are really focused on still PhD/just out of PhD 3) the application requirements are really specific in terms of statement content. Basically had to rewrite all of my materials. While I appreciate that this is a unique program, do they realize how much work this is?! I hope the program coordinators/search committee see this and understand it is going to be a barrier for some applicants. 4) Thanks #2! Was going to apply for this but will forget about it and save the time. 5) If you're interested in applying I highly recommend contacting someone in the department you'd want to be placed in (i.e. the chair, who may refer you to the chair of the INVEST search for that department), they will have a lot more info about what each department is looking to prioritize. FWIW, someone I talked to wasn't even aware that the application asked for all of those specific requirements for statement content; they were not looking for them as the departmental search committee and only expected standard research, teaching, and DEI statements, so if you submit your normal materials it may be fine. (Completely agree that it's a barrier for the college-wide search to ask for very specific statements, particularly if the departments don't care). (6) Thanks @5. Also just want to chime in to say that if you're looking to recruit diverse faculty, prefacing what you're looking for with terms like ""brilliance"" is going to cause many such people (incl. myself) to feel like we're not qualified... (7) @6 i dont understand the contradition between recruiting diverse faculty and brilliance. oh my... 8) Just to weigh in, I'm putting an application together now and it only seems to be asking for the standard statements. (6) @7 what I mean is that individuals from underrepresented backgrounds often have self-images where we don't view ourselves as ""brilliant"". Individuals whose self-image is of a ""brilliant"" person seem more likely to be from over-represented groups. 9) Does anyone have insights on the timeline to expect for this program? 10) Zoom interview request (x2) 11) References requested, but no zoom interview 12) @10 and @11 What departments did you apply to? 10) @12 Marine & Environmental Science. 11) same as 10, not really sure how to interpret them only asking for letters the same day as inviting zoom interviews... (12) No letters or interview here, congrats to you all! (13) Does anyone know if this is a 'DEI Search'?

But did you know that a professor in the dept helped with its curation? Or that profs in the dept. are actively advocating for students? Not sure where the assertion that they have a hard time recruiting PhD students is coming from; I'm a former student/current post-doc and that has never been a topic of conversation, if anything profs want to accept more students than the dept. has funding for.. 3) Recent PhD there and agree with #2. It's a wonderful department with extremely supportive faculty. I loved it there. Many faculty are extremely sympathetic to the stipend issue. 4) Current PhD here and despite the sympathy, there is lack of action and a well known recruitment issue. Im glad 2&3 had great times, but there is a serious issue with # of PhD students and # of advisors, as well as $. 5) U/FL has a horrible reputation with grad students and postdocs. horrible.   6) This is your gentle reminder that while this department is the origin of the biology stipend website, it is equally true that the people who created that website did so because they knew they were not the only department with stipend issues. 7) @6 I reccomend talking with the stipend website developers before claimng their motivations. 8) When I was a graduate student in the dept, I enjoyed it a lot, as did pretty much all the grad students I interacted with on a regular basis. Agree the grad salaries could be higher, but GNV is a pretty affordable place to live 9) The MIT living wage for GNV is 34k, the lowest stipend is 18K.

Search chair asked about marital status and made awkward comments about it. A total of 3 people came to my research talk, including not a single person from the department other than the chair. Either (a) really dysfunctional department, or (b) they already had an internal candidate in mind and everyone in the department thought the interview was a sham. It's one thing to have an internal candidate (as has been discussed here, this cuts both ways), but the whole experience was incredibly unprofessional on their part, and I have not considered any jobs there in the years since. Hopefully this is a different situation...*to be fair, the chair at the time is no longer at the institution 3) It would seem to be odd for them to be advertising three jobs simultaneously and have internal candidates for all three at an institution that doesn't offer PhDs, my guess is this is an institutional approach?  4) You're probably right @3, though they do sort of offer PhDs through UMaine, and most internal candidates are not PhD students but VAPs or something similar. Three at the same time seems odd though, maybe its a budget thing or maybe they just want to speed up the timeline. I can't imagine an institutional policy to have all jobs start reviewing candidates immediately though.  5) It is a very unusual college in how it is structured and how many jobs are teaching only. 6) @2/4, could you elaborate on the PhD program through UMaine? One reason I would NOT apply is that I would like to mentor doctoral students. Is it possible to do so through this program, in your experience? Thanks! 3) FWIW, I contacted an admin and they stated that they won't begin review until 11/9/22, so it sounds like there are cutoffs for full consideration (I imagine it would be hard to be fully considered after that date) that are not being advertised 7) I can't find any current info on their PhD partnership with UMaine-perhaps it had been through a grant. But, it was something similar to this https://www.une.edu/research/cen/students/graduate 8) This is a masters only graudate program with the College of Arts and Sciences. The position replaces a long standing biological oceanographer, though I don't think the search is limited to that expertise 9) Anyone Hear anything? 10) Not yet (11/17) x4 11) invitation for zoom interview (11/21) x2 12) Anyone hear post Zoom? Or know when they are hoping to decide inpersons? 13) I believe on campus invites have gone out for this position (or are just about to) 14) I was told goal was ~2 weeks from zoom interviews 15) Has anyone actually been invited for an in-person? 16) No as of 12/13 x2 17) Invited for full interview (1/9)","8","University of New England",FALSE,"ME",161457,"Biddeford","R2 Doctoral Universities: High Research Activity","Professions plus arts & sciences, some graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Single program-Education","Four-year, full-time, inclusive, lower transfer-in","Majority graduate","Four-year, medium, highly residential","Not Classified","New England CT ME MA NH RI VT","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Private not-for-profit",1,"Suburb Midsize","No","Yes","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,558,609,73,362,0,1602,6881,5,8,240,0,0,0,73,0,73,13,958,198,360,0,0,7483,12232,7208,5659.333333,4065,3143,2260,40,32,1733,2593,550,560,4,104,6,NA,NA,18,51,NA,875,0.546192,34,15,9,0.264706,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",1,0,0,5,1,1580,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4843,4226,0.8726,1

All candidates must indicate how they would help communicate and support the Catholic and Jesuit identity and mission of the University.” To be clear, you will never be asked about religion while interviewing or working here. We are a Jesuit institution (like many others including Georgetown, Gonzaga, Boston College, etc.) and so we are encouraged to use the general principles of Jesuit education in our teaching (e.g. cura personalis, individual attention to students).

Would anonymizing a research statement include taking out all links to your publications? (You could link to pubs without including your name in the citation, but if someone clicks it, they'd know) 7) Unclear instructions, posted less than a month before its due, no clear direction, I would think they are trying to recruit an internal candidate but then it'd be very specific not very general, right? And what's with the anonymization? 'Color-blind' review processes are about as effective as Reaganomics. A person's identity is a relevant part of their experience, especially for a diversity statement. 8) someone on the search committee confirmed Nov 12 review date. 9) REALLY need a SC member to comment on what the heck anonymized means and why it is required. @9. Same. I dont know how I can do any anonymized talk about my own research or my experiences as x,y,z in in the diversity statement. 10) I applied to the UM Duluth campus last year, and they described how to do this, not sure they follow the same guidelines at the twin cities campus: https://scse.d.umn.edu/about/swenson-college-faculty-searches/search-faq Ignore the first half about other job ads and scroll to this section: ""What do you mean by an anonymized research and teaching statement?"" 11) @10 link is dead for me @11 fixed it, I added a period at the end, sorry 12) ok, after reading the link @10 I am more mad. This will take a LOT of work to do. How am i supposed to speak to specific and unique DEI and teaching opportunities I have had while hiding where they took place? I get the idea in spirit but this is just more work for the applicant and probably transparent anyway.  14) asking for diej is nothing but grandstanding.  if you're a bigot you'll just say what they want to hear. 13) Perhaps I'm missing something, but after reading the link @10 (thanks!), it doesn't seem that much work... x2 14) It seems the link to that faq doesn't work now? 15) I also applied to the Duluth campus and it was not a lot of work to convert statements, @12 simply use the phrase ""my current institution"". A little work goes a long way to make a more fair and unbiased search process. 16) Any confirmation that the link above applies to this search? It isn't for same campus.  @15 even when searches use anonymized statements, people note that it doesn't work well for DEIJ statements (https://www.science.org/content/article/can-anonymous-faculty-searches-boost-diversity), they are too personal to be anonymous. 17) I think for me the most frustrating part is asking for all of this (something that is not the norm for job calls) and not providing ANY resouces and links or just commentary on it. It feels a it like ""hey figure out what we mean by this and make it work so we can feel more like we are approaching DEI and hiring better"". 18) Just got an email clarification from someone on the search committee for this call. They said ""For anonymizing statements, simply removing your name from your research, teaching, and DEIJ statements is sufficient. For example, when citing your papers in your research statement, you could simply replace your name with 'Applicant' or something similar. We are trying to reduce our implicit bias. There is no need to remove your name from your CV or any other documents, as we will look at these materials (for all applicants) after evaluating the anonymized portions of the application materials."" 19) Heads up, this also requires FOUR not three letters of recommendation. Not up front, but probably more than most are expecting. 20) @18 Thank you for the info. Just checking, so then there is no need to also delete institution, neither journal names? Also, I couldn't find an email to who to write for questions in the job add. 21) Is anyone else struggling with this submission system? It's horrible! I've started this application three times, saved my progress as a draft. Then when I try to access it later by clicking ""apply now"" it says I've got an incomplete and unsubmitted draft, would I like to apply again? If I click yes, it takes me to a blank application and I have to start over. If I click no, it does nothing. Anyway, maybe don't click apply until you have all your documents prepped. 22) I'm literally gonna send this in redacted like a CIA classified document. Here's how to do it https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/hub/how-to/how-to-black-out-text-in-a-pdf-file  23) I always find the anonymized idea ridiculous.  People know who works on what, and it's really easy to find out who wrote that pub on sea slug genetics in the south carribean.  I don't think it helps as much as they pretend it does.  Even under anon review I get references to my prior work stating clearly that I am the first author.  24) it is a ridiculous concept. 25) Maybe a little early given the most likely high number of applications, but has anyone heard anything? 24) Nope x20 (25) Nothing as of Dec 8 x16. (26) Nothing as of 12/13 x7 27) Looks increasinly likely that this will a post holiday decision 28) Have heard that there were ~ 220 applicantions submitted. (29) Lower than I'd expect based on the 10X 'number applied' column. Here that would suggest nearly 500. 28) That is what I would have expected too- but evidently not! 29) waiting for an update here is killing me! x5 30) Semester hasn't started. I am not expecting to hear anhything until the end of January 31) Any news (32) No as of 1/13 x6 (33) No as of 1/20 x7 (34) Department seminar lists invited speakers as coming 2/8, 2/15, 2/22 (35) link? I don't see (34) Member of department here (non-faculty), they just sent a department email with the semester schedule 36) Are they listed as candidates? No one on this sheet got an interview? 37) there are no names listed on the seminar schedule. 38) huh weird......... 39) Sounds like they haven't announced the decisions but are optimistic that those dates will work for candidates. Honestly they should consider dates in March, most departments have gotten back to people in December/January to schedule talks for Feb.x5 37) Or maybe those dates are for the Ichtyology search that sent out campus invites earlier this month? 38) @37 you have kept my hope alive! let's hope that's it :-) 39) I have a bad feeling about it based on the information here. 40) Candidate for the Ichthyology job here: these are two separate departments in two separate colleges (FWCB vs EEB), I can't see them sharing a seminar series. The Ichthyology job listed possible visit dates as Thursdays in Feb or 1st Thurs in March for the FWCB department. 41) So they skipped the long list and went straight for the shortlist? Bizarre. 42) I'm not willing to believe anything until someone posts that they got an interview. (43) IIRC no letters were required for this job. I am near-certain that we're still waiting. (44) also stated they had a weird decision-making process (first cuts made based on statements, not CV) so I would not be shocked that this is taking foooooreeeeeveeeer. (45) ok what the heck is up with this search!? no news here and the first interviewee seminar is Feb 8!? they must have sent out invitations and no one here got one?? (34) Back with good news- those seminar dates have been ruled 'meaningless' after checking with a search committee member. Nothing on-site for a long while still.(35)  @34 Thanks for checking in on that for us! x6 36) Def nice to get some clarification on this, but ""a long while"" uff would be nice if job things lined up with eachother a bit 37) THey should take a lesson from the Mizzou job that has been sending updates b/c of the length of time its requiring to do blind reviews 38) The length of time this is taking will require most candidates to make other job arrangements for next year before even getting an INVITE at this point. This is a crazyyyy slow process. 39) At this point 90% of the jobs are closed and in the process of negotiating or on-campus interviews. I wonder the impact that might have on their selected pool once --if ever-- they get there. (40) I hope they go straight to in person and skip zoom. At this stage they might even need to skip letter requests. (41) Both of those might be HR requirements. Letters likely are, and take only a week to turn around, but don't expect the letters to be part of the decision making process beyond basic personality screening. 42) is there anyone here with insider insight on whats going on? This is one of the most applied to, slowest, and least transparent processes we have seen this cycle. 43) I have heard that the dean asked the department to hire someone late in the year, so the department had to put the search together at the last minute. They're probably doing their best under the circumstances - though info from the SC regarding progress here would obviously keep us from refreshing every hour and be much appreciated. 44) No idea if this may be causing the delay but I think there has been a lot of turnover with staff lately in the college from HR to admin/office positions. 45) Info from EEB: This search is taking a long time, for a number of reasons - late word that search was possible, breadth of the search, delays in HR, etc... I believe currently aiming to have interviews in late March, but invitations have not yet gone out. 46) Dunno about you, but I've started checking this space regularly for updates on the mystery and drama of it all. Academic jobs are so competitive, I'm confident they'll have strong candidates despite it being so slow. x5 (47) yes, very interested to see how this turns out, especially with the anonymized process. if it works well, that could be a model for other institutions. 48) Other institutions have done it: UConn last year, University of Washington a couple years ago... At some point all these institutions should share their experience and write a best practice (instead of always reinventing the wheels). (49) letters requested as a ""semi-finalist"" x3 (50) To you or letter writers? (51) not 49, but directly to my letter writers. (49) yeah, directly to letter writers x4 (52) https://tinyurl.com/mrebzyab (53) @52 😂😭 x3 (54) any idea how many ""semi-finalists"" there are? x 2. (55) at least 5 based on this job board. (56) For people who had letters requested, any new information? I haven't heard anything in 2 weeks. (58) I received an email from the SC indicating that missing letters wouldn't be a problem a few days after my letter writers were contacted. Aside from that, no. I assume everyone got that email? 59) Same, nothing since the letter communications 60) Invited for on campus interview (Invite received 3/3) x4 (61) not me! oh well, good luck! (62) congrats! Does the email mention how many people they are interviewing? (63) I think they invited 6 (63) for the people invited for in-person interviews, do you mind telling us what group do you work with? (64) how many 'semi-finalist' were considered? (65) I heard there are 6 folks invited x3 (65) Rejection email recieved 4/13 x3 (66) Not invited for on campus interview, but no rejection email received (67) heard that an offer was made 4/27 x2 (68) Nothing public yet about this search's outcome? (69) I believe this is the position Solomon David announced? https://twitter.com/SolomonRDavid/status/1653845997636780034 (70) If so, Dr. David seems fantastic. But I have to say it is incredibly disheartening to see this job go to a prof moving institutions. One of the best positions on the open market at Asst Prof level this year. Would be curious how many postdocs vs profs interviewed. 71) I don't think Dr. David's position is this one since he apparently is in the FWCB dept, and this position was for EEB. Also, fwiw, I interviewed and am a postdoc. (70 again) OK, interesting. I did not interview but did apply, and hope a postdoc can make the cut here 72) last I heard, an asst prof was invited for a second visit (70) That's a major drag. 71) Any news on whether that person was hired? 72) Offer accepted but deferred start date to 2024 73) Congratulations!!

We recommend this statement be up to approximately 2-3 pages in length."" 2) Upon submission I got an error that said the submission was unsuccessful, but when I tried again it said I had already submitted an application. I have not yet recieved a confirmation email. Anyone experience something similar? x5 3) @ 2, the same thing happened to me and I never received a confirmation email. 4) @2,3: Same for me, but the application and all of my docs showed up as a completed application under the ""Your Applications"" tab on the left. I think as long as it shows there, it should be fine. 5) For those who already submitted, were your reference writers contacted automatically as it states in the submission? Job app says they won't be, but I never trust an automated system 6) interested in response to 5, I would prefer my current director not know of this until absolutely necessary 7) Just submitted, system said submission successful, and I received a confirmation email. No idea about reference contacts though. 8) talked to refs listed, no one received an email 9) What's it like to live in Williamsburg/Newport News with a young family? 10) @9, good schools, lots to do (colonial williamsburg, historic jamestown, lots of public parks, a 45 min drive from VA beach and 2 hrs from mountains), area is slightly conservative, much moreso in Gloucester County where VIMS is located. Source: lived in the area for 8 yrs 11) Anyone hear anything? 12) no, as of 11/15/22 x9 13) Just got a hit on my website from Williamsburg...maybe they're still sifting through apps x2 14) anyone hear anything back? 15) no word yet 11/25 x5 16) Any news? 17) None 18) same, no news as of 12/5/22 x10 19)I wonder how many overall applicants this call got, and how many from eco/evo type folks. 20) Received invite for Digital Interview on 12/7 x6. 21) What is this digital interview?! I'm guessing you just record yourself answering interview questions? 22) @21 yep.... describe fit #peakawkward 23) @22 I haven't clicked the link yet... is there a list of Q's? Can you re-record your answers or do you get one shot? @23 idk. I opened the link and it gives you the prompt. No idea how long to take. Also didn't show the 3 written questions. i'm going to take today to be happy then email before the weekend. 24) Glad to see I'm not the only one confused by this ""digital interview"". I can't find questions, expected duration, possibility to redo, etc. Like @23, I'll just celebarate this today and think about the details tomorrow :)  25) For digital interviews generally, I've heard you get Qs and one or a few min to respond with no do-overs... not sure how VIMS is doing it, but being able to prep answers would be much more inclusive 26) I was just thinking to myself ""wow I wish being on the job market was even harder and more confusing""...thanks VIMS! Gratefully acknowledging that any interview is a good opportunity of course. Others please do update if you learn anything more about the process! x2 27) Gotta say I'm a bit surprised (and obv disappointed) not to have received that same email request, despite how bizarre it sounds. What's it take to get an interview these days? Geez. 28) @27, I feel you. It's a crapshoot. 29) Does we think this means they won't review more applications on the 1/5/2023 second deadline listed in the posting? 30) !!! Long post - this was a response from HR regarding how the digital interview works:  You’ll receive your questions in two parts (video and written). Part 1 of 2 will be the video portion. You’ll see the question listed in the “QUESTIONS IN THIS PART” just above the get started boxes (see attached in my sample screen shot the question is listed as “1. This is a test video question…”). By viewing this question in advance you can prepare your response before selecting “get started.” Once you select “get started” you will have an opportunity to test your mic and video then record a practice round; you can do this as many times as you’d like but it will not be recorded. Following your practice you’ll select the “START REAL INTERVIEW” option. This button will begin your recorded interview response (you will have 3 attempts, but only the most recent attempt will be kept for submission). After completing your video response you will receive a similar screen with Part 2 of 2, in which the questions for your written responses will be displayed. Again, you can take your time drafting your responses to the listed questions (in a separate Word document, if you choose). Once you select the “GET STARTED” button a 10 minute timer will begin to record your written response. At any time in the process you can close the window to stop the interview then use your link to return where you left off; however, progress will not be saved (ie if you started writing a response and close the window it will not be saved (but remember you can draft your response before beginning the written portion). The interview link expires 10 days from when it was sent (yesterday). !!! 31) So the first video question is ""How do you see your research and teaching goals complementing the work of others at VIMS and advancing our strategic plan?"". But has anyone gone further than that? How long can the answer be? And what are the following questions?  32) Tempted to ask them for written Qs to limit redundancy in our responses. Also for the 3/4 written questions can we just copy+paste from word? 33) Just bumping this in case anyone has made any progress. Frustrating to no know if there is a time limit for the video response, and what the following written questions are...  34) Haven't started yet but found out the written responses can be prepped in Word and then pasted - so the 10min typing limit seems irrelevant. 35) The practice video response is 1 minute. Can anyone confirm that's the time limit for the actual video response (this seems very short). 36) its 4min I believe 37) Any updates (1/2)? 38) Or, any idea if they are going to have another review for the next 1/5/23 deadline? 39) Got an email saying a reference had been recieved for this position, so I assume they've asked for letters (1/4) x4 40) @39 were you part of the first round or did you submit for the 1/5/23 deadline? 41) Not @39 but I also received letter request and had submitted for 1st round x4 42) On-campus invite recieved (1/13) x2  43) I had no word till today saying they're reviewing digital interview responses... A bit confused by what this means when others have on-campus interviews 44) @43 its a cluster hire so maybe they're continuously reviewing the pool of applicants as they find people to fit certain niches? They had a 2nd review date of 1/5 so they may be reviewing previous applicants along with any new applicants? Just guessing though.  43) Yeah they confirmed different position hires are happening at different times, hence only a few invites sent out so far   44) Ecological modeler here, got on-campus invite 2/7/23 45) @44 thanks for adding your field, very helpful! and if others want to do the same as invites roll out that would be great 46) Any news from the first round? 47) 8 March, nothing... 48) They currrently have scheduled 12 on-campus interviews, not sure if they'll be adding any more at this time. 49) @48 Do you know if that is 12 total or 12 in addition to the first round? 50) @48 I was one of the 12 and a first rounder, but not sure about the others 51) re-re-re-rejected 3/22. No idea what they are doing over there 52) Anyone know if any offers have gone out yet? 53) I've had no news as of 4/3. 54) I reached out because of a competing offer and nobody seems to be responding to emails. 55) @54, willing to bet that means the SC has submitted their recommendations and everything is in the hands of admin. Sometimes SCs are asked to discontinue any discussion with candidates at that point. 56) I just got my phone rejection (interviewed on campus). Got confirmation that 4 offers have been made and are sufficiently far along in negotiations that I got the call. Congrats to you winners - bummed about this one! 57) I didn't even get a rejection call, just ghosted I guess :( ","23",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

National average is irrelevant.  Try using a median instead. 4) @ 3 lipstick on a pig... x5 5) Disagree with @3 that this is typical. I've seen CSU postdoc salaries higher than that. 3) I'm not arguing that it is a what you are worth.  But, its pretty typical for a masters level university.  AAUP stats published in the Chronicle of Higher Education report asst prof salaries avg below that.  IPEDS data demonstrate it too.  Regional state Universities are a different world from R1 institutions.  6) Keep in mind that 62K is at Associate Prof and 52K is Assistant. I make 61K as a postdoc in one of the lowest cost of living areas in the country. WAYYYYYY underpaid and its not even close.  3) I am, I can read IPEDS and AAUP data.  Most regionals will not start over 70K for asst prof.  Its just reality.  Even a lot of R1s start lower than that. 7) This is not CSU, it is CSU-Pueblo. The salary is both unfortunately low and unfortunately representative of this type of regional university, of which there are many.  8) from posting on TAMU ""Please note: we are hiring a visiting assistant professor for Spring '23 and an assistant or associate professor to start Fall '23.

This is pretty late! 14) @13, I agree super late, but I have a collaborator at Scripps who said they'd keep me posted when/if they hear about it, and they've heard nothing. 15) emailed search chair 2/3, said ""long list"" selected but can't notify until HR approval. So hang tight... 16) Ooof. This one is killing me with this suspense...x3 17) Email Feb 8th, asking for zoom interview. To be frank, I thought this one had already moved on, so am happily surprised! x4 18) Hooray! Me too! ...and likewise, I thought this had moved on without me. 17 again) Wonder how long the long-list is, seems like 5-6 of us from the spreadsheet got zoom-interviews 18) :( 19) Official rejection email 2/11 20) strange that they're sending out rejection emails already? I feel like usually schools wait until they've at least done some interviews, or often until they've made an offer. 20) Had the Zoom interview today; it felt kind of cold and awkward. Hopefully mine just didn't go well, and some of the rest of ya'll had better experiences. Good luck! I'm guessing I'm out of contention after that...21) don't worry @20, my zoom interview also felt intensely awkward and silent... 22) @21, uh oh! I'm relieved it wasn't just me, but sorry to hear that. 23) has anyone heard about on-campus interviews yet? It's been a couple of weeks since my zoom interview with them 3/12 24) I had mine on 2/28, and asked them about next steps + timeline - they said it might take them until end of March to be ready announce on-campus invites. 25) thanks @24! They are certainly on their own super late timeline for everything! 26) In-person invite email received morning Mar 20 x3 26) Congrats! 27) congrats everyone! When did they schedule the interviews for? Sad I didn't get an on-campus. Mar 29 28) Just seeing this all now- also got a relatively cold zoom interview (was so grateful there were 2 women on the search committee; it made such a big, tangible difference to see them smiling at me) and didn't get a rejection but also no in-person interview - congrats to those who did! 29) To be fair, as someone who did alot of Zoom interviews this year, Scripps weren't any ""colder"" than the other places I Zoom'd. I just think in an effort to be fair across everyone they kept it kind of sterile, with no engagement beyond the asked questions (which was something I saw pretty much all other places do) 30) Based on my experiences if you got a smile you're doing pretty well. My worst so far was a few blurry, masked humanlike forms at the far end of one of those Vladimir Putin tables 31) did anyone who did an on-campus ask about when they expect to make an offer by? 32) has anyone heard anything? Still super late! I wonder if it will fail or had already failed? 33) they didn't give an answer on the timeline. I interviewed late in April, and got the impression there might have been 1-2 others after me left to interview. 34) any news from this search? 35) I emailed yesterday inquiring, no news yet though, 36) thanks! 37) They said in the email that they already contacted someone as their final candidate 38) at least we know..","8","University of California-San Diego",TRUE,"CA",110680,"La Jolla","R1 Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity","Arts & sciences plus professions, high graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Comprehensive programs, with medical/veterinary school","Four-year, full-time, more selective, higher transfer-in","High undergraduate","Four-year, large, highly residential","Not Classified","Far West AK CA HI NV OR WA","Public, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Public",1,"City Large","Yes","Yes","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,8395,2235,553,193,0,11376,1395348,8387,1764,2482,43,43,425,42,511,42,1771,657,6695,1700,0,0,38736,40547,39576,38573.333333,31842,7734,30939,888,0,15,7133,601,6423,24,3251,83,NA,NA,24,26,NA,1868,0.164205,70,117,44,0.628571,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,1,20,18,17598,5723,2191,620,650,1270,28,26,26.553702,100062,36634,0.366113,3

Folks on this list may be interested in the ecology and/or evolution position (broadly defined), invertebrate biology (any field), bioinformatics (could include a big-data geneticist), or the STEM education position. 1) Can anyone comment on the stress level there of moving from R2 into R1 status? 2) @1 Research expectations remain similar to R2, especially because the Department of Biology has a high number of undergraduates (while also having a robust PhD program) and research with students is emphasized and appreciated. 3) 2-page each research and teaching statement? What a joke 4) Application to be sent via email to the SC chair. Is that weird? 5) Lake Forest College also requested applications be sent via email. May be uncommon, but not weird. I also don't view the page limit as a joke. Seems doable and standard to me. x6 6) Anyone get confirmation their app was received? 7) No. x4 8) No, and i explicitly asked for it in my email. Disrespectful IMO. x3 9) glad to hear (sort of--yikes) I am not the only one who didn't receive confirmation.x2 10) Has anyone heard anything yet? 10) nope x5 11) Zoom invite (for Env Sci) 12/8 12) What??

It has been a long time since applications were due 19) the submission of apps via email, lack of acknowledgment of receipt, and now the very long time with no word, this is starting to feel pretty ameteurish. Red flag? 20) I don't think so, or at least you should give the benefit of the doubt. It is a big search being a cluster hire. 21) Contacted for phone interview 22) I was contacted to see if I was still interested in the position but they didn't set up a phone interview. @21 did they set up an actual zoom interview for you? @22 the caller said the SC will be in touch for the set up for the zoom interview 23) Ok this seems like an unusual process and I have questions. 1. They contacted you by phone, email, or both? 2. Which position(s) did you apply for? 3. When were you contacted? 4. (rhetorical) who answers their phone anymore?! 24) I was also contacted yesterday 2/7 (phone call) and was asked if I was still interested on the position.

However the committee is usually very broad and includes people from the civil side as well-- make sure you make your materials accessible and make a strong case for impact!  2) Here again.

Are letters required up front? 5) I think I've applied, difficult to tell from their system (no submit button). Are we meant to wait for requests for letters of rec or not 6) The email I got after uploading materials says ""An application will be considered complete when we have received three letters of reference --- to be solicited directly by each applicant."" So my best guess is its not complete without those letters and you need to make sure your writers submit them since the system won't request them automatically. However, that was NOT clear in the job ad and is really frustrating when you've done all of the work to submit and its not considered on time due to needing rec letters. Some grace would be nice. 7) I totally relate to you! I am similarly worried about my own letters and my own application.  8) I did not have letters submitted up front with my application (and agree with #5 - it was difficult to know if my app was even submitted).

Winter is wet and foggy, but not particularly cold (relative to other parts of Germany or similar latitudes in N. America). Not much snow in a typical winter, but we are very close to the alps and world class skiing, if snow is your thing. 6) Qfor 5), do you think you'll be recruiting for more junior folk as well as some point? 5 again) What level of position are you interested in? For postdocs and grad students we very frequently have open positions in animal behavior, usually through the Centre for the Advanced Study of Animal Behaviour or the closely-associated Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior. Check those websites for current opportunities. Group leader and above is harder. I don't know of plans for recruitment (not to say they don't exist). There are usually calls for group leader applications each year, e.g. Lise Meitner groups or positions through the central Max Planck office. There are also a number of external grant programs here in Germany/Europe that would fund a group leader position - worth it to reach out to science administrators at either the MPI-AB or CASCB if you'd be interested in applying for such and want to be hosted in Konstanz. 6) what's happened to the job ad?

Also note: no separate DEI statement, but include DEI efforts in research & teaching statements as appropriate (not popular). -AP]  2) Thanks AP. (3) Dear SC: Asking for a DEI statement merged with research statement is extremely unconventional! 4) SC member here: if you have research-related DEI activities, include them in your research statement; if you have teaching/mentoring-related DEI activities, include them in your teaching statement. We don't expect everyone to have both categories. 5) @ SC - what about service related DEI activities? 6) heads up: although the linked job ad says that application materials should be combined into one PDF, the website to apply has spots to upload documents individually and seems to indicate that the PDF will be concatenated by the system (though there was no way to double check that happened) 7) @5, I'm not SC, but I'm mentioning my service-related DEI activities in my cover letter. 8) 'Extremely unconventional' is very diplomatic: this merged DEI/Research and DEI/Teaching format is crazy. 9) Yea, SC members, if you are still hear to read this: I think my DEi efforts are seriously reduced and diluted by forcing this format change that nobody else seems to have. A lot of my DEI activities have been service related, because *spoiler alert* I don't have big grants through which to have made research DEI impacts, nor as a postdoc do I control who I teach or even mentor. So all the extra time I spend on DEI in service areas is either hamfisted into teaching statement (poorly) or cut. I can't be the only one. 4) SC member again: sorry for the format of the DEI statement, this was completely out of our control. I'll be sure to forward your feedback to the relevant authorities for future searches. Put your service-related DEI in either the cover letter or the teaching statement - we'll find it in any case. Sorry y'all! 10) isn't salary 60000.00-85000.00 Salary Commensurate with Experience a bit low? found this info here: https://careers.msu.edu/en-us/job/512493/assistant-professortenure-system 4) @10 SC member here: I have no idea where that salary range came from (HR?) but it doesn't reflect the salaries of recently hired asst profs, which have all exceeded that upper limit. I'll reach out to whoever gets the offer with a range of comps so you have good info for negotiation. 10) thanks a lot for your reply @4 ! it was preventing me from applying (maybe not only me)... 11) Another search comm member here. That salary range definitely isn't right. Salaries here are comparable to other R1s. 12) just wanna say I really appreciate the SC members coming here to clarify, help, and forward feedback. We appreciate you  4) SC again: @12 thanks! We're working through 159 applications now, stay tuned. 13) 159 is almost exactly 10x the applied number here, more evidence this trend is alive and well 14) Any updates? 15) 159 seems very low for such a broad job description.. any ideas why this job didn't get more applications? 16) Guessing ""quantitative"" caused many people to self-select out of this application. Given that truly broad apps like Minnesota and U. Arizona probably got 400-500 applications, 150 (~30-40%) seems reasonable as a fraction of those applicants who identify as quantitative! Interested in other theories or inside knowledge about this! 17) Maybe fewer people want to move to Lansing, MI? Or it's not considered a ""trade-up"" school for Profs already in TT position? 18) @17 not historically the case for MSU, it's a pretty desirable program. 19) any update? 20) nothing here 12/10 21) SC again: don't expect any news until January. Happy holidays folks! 22) Thanks, SC! Happy holidays x4 23) Any news? 24) SC here: don't expect anything before end of Jan. 25) It's the end of January! Expecting to hear something this week  SC) 🫡 26) Letters requested 01/27 x5 SC) Letters requested of 21 applicants, glad to see a bunch of you on here. 27) Letters requested for 21 out of 159... well that's tough for those of us whose letters haven't been requested! lol 28) 21 is an odd number... 29) So is 159? 30) Not really…. You don't control how many applicants apply but you control how many make it to the intermediate list… 30) My guess from serving on previous search committees is that they did not have a set number of candidates they wanted to keep on the medium/short list, but simply retained as many applicants as they were still interested in @30) 21 and 159 are boh odd numbers, neither is a multiple of 2... 31) loo(x4)ool 32) any update? 2/10 33) Given what just happened at MSU, I would expect some delays.. :( 34) So sad and horrifying 35) SC members, if you're reading this, we're thinking of you! Hope you can take care of yourselves and your communities x8 36) On campus interview invitation 2/24 x2  SC) @34-35, thanks for the kind thoughts. @36, looking forward to meeting you next month. Keeping with our odd theme, we invited 5 for interviews, but would be delighted to have all of you as colleagues. 37) @SC Thank you for being so informative throughout this process, we really appreciate it. Makes it extra sad to miss out on this one!   38) As one of the 16, I am curious how ""quantitative"" this hire ends up being, but indeed thanks for the frequent updates! 37) https://twitter.com/gsvidaurre/status/1646520947430805507 38) @37 how confident are you that the person from twitter who got a job at MSU got this quantitative ecology position rather than another position? Specifically, see https://provost.msu.edu/priorities-and-initiatives/1855-professorships 39) Yeah, I think interviews ended a week ago, so this seems like a really quick timeline for someone to already have signed paperwork. I think the twitter post is a different position. SC) @39 correct, she was hired for a separate search. Our interviews are done (thanks for coming out, interviewees) and the process is moving ahead. 40) Thanks SC, does this mean that an offer has been made?  SC) @40 not yet as far as I know - our job as SC is done 41) If anyone does know if an offer has been made, please share here 42) Offer made (it was not me though..., sigh x2) [already verified that the tweet above in 37) was not part of this search -AP] 43) Offer accepted? 44) More than one offer was made and one has been accepted but the other is still pending. 45) the person that got the second offer rejected it.

The consensus is that you do not need to disclose that you are applying for both position in the Cover Letter. If you are invited for an on-campus interview for both searches, then we will figure out how to deal with this overlap. Thanks! 9) I just want to say that EEB at UCONN is a fantastic department to work in (former postdoc there). SC member: :-) 10) Bummer! Seems the listing is closed already (10/30) ... have written to see if this is a mistake. 11) SC member: I'll check on this... we were definitely expecting to receive applications until 11/1!

We are excited to announce a Diversity Equity and Inclusion cluster hire search, with candidates recruited from all areas of Biology."" 5) does a DEI cluster hire mean people who are from underrepresented groups, or anyone who has a strong track record of engagement with DEI work? 6) Good questions for the chair @5. In my experience, it usually means the latter. I've been in plenty of DEI spaces where the diversity was a Midwesterner in a Southern state. Granted, they might have been disabled or from a low-income background. 7) From the list of qualifications in the ad: ""Evidence of commitment to or strong potential for the advancement of diversity, equity, and inclusion for underrepresented minority students and groups (African-American/Black, Latino (a) Chicano (A)/Hispanic, and Native American), and how this commitment integrates with teaching, research and service."" 8) If they're pushing for more DEI have they fixed the fee/stipend situation? A few years ago there was a lot coming out about students barely surviving on their stipends. Would be a substantial barrier to anyone they hire. 9) I'm faculty at LSU and in response to @8, we were able to get the grad student fees waived (thank goodness). I believe it goes into action sometime in 2024. 10) PhD alum of dept here. Despite budget woes and state-level issues, I cannot recommend this enough as a wonderful, collaborative, collegial, thriving dept for EEB x4 11) @9, do you know why it is taking so long to waive the fees? This issue was brought up a while ago, that seems like a long time to wait to change an issue that actively harms student wellbeing. 12) @11 this is happenning almost solely through grad student activism, including forming an Union, and it took AN ACT OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE, which has passed and been signed by the governor, so please hold your horses. It will happen when it happens, but IT WILL HAPPEN, which is the most important part. Chill out. x3 13) SC Member here - graduate student fee removal will be in place starting Fall 2024. 14) Document upload limited to 5MB. To keep figures in statements in good shape, I had to reduce quality of rep pubs.15) Having the same issue as @14 but still cannot get it to be small enough given length of pubs etc.  16) Me either. any tips? 17) i had the same issue and finally got it to 4.9 using a combination of acrobat and preview ""reduce file size"" function. preview sometimes made the file _bigger_, be warned, but acrobat consistently shrunk it. i had to reduce files separately, reduce size of figures in my statement doc, reduce my cv... just cut them all back as much as posisble. it was kind of miserable. good luck! 18) Yes @16 use acrobat and compress your pubs (usually the main hog!) I tried to avoid compressing anything else to prevent loss of clarity etc on the msot important. They can always search for pubs later. 19) Anyone having trouble getting the Voluntary Disclosures page of the application to load properly? No drop down choices appearing for multiple questions, some of which are required! Nevermind, just need to switch from Chrome to Safari - problem fixed. 20) Any news? 21) zoom interview. x7 (letters requested at the same time) 22) congrats all! x4 23) Rejection email 12/15 x4 24) I do apreciate a rejection email after a reasonable amount of time.

Someone must have found a position or is not interested? @14) congrats. you got the invite that is all that matters! 13) Thank you @14! You are totally right. 15) email. We moved forward. Nice they let us know. @15) I am not following your post, can you clarify? 16) For those with on-campus interview, did you receive a range of dates for potential visits? I'm still waiting for that info. 17) @16 - I am also in that boat. I was informed that I had been selected for on-campus interview the first week of January, but have since gotten several emails that say there is a delay in scheduling my interview. I am wondering if its becuase this is a multiple department hire? Or they have preferecnes and they are interviewing those people first perhaps. Its odd, and I am not sure what to make of it. Stil waiting for invitation with dates, etc. 18) I heard from the chair on 1/13 that they are still gathering the dates that committee members are available. A friend in one of the departments (not on the search comittee) said that they have not seen a schedule of talks released yet. I hope that helps. 19) @18 - yes it does help! Thank you! x2 20) Anybody hear anything at all?  21) I was asked about dates that did not work for my interview on 1/19. 22) On campus interview scheduled 1/25. 23) Do you know how many candidates were invited for on-campus interview? 24) I am guessing they invited 9 candidates - 3 for each of the positions they are looking for- A tonne of work. 25) they invited 13 candidates for interviews 26) has anyone heard any final news about these positions? 26) I have not heard any news but the last interview slot was last Friday. I don't know how fast things will move. 27) Ah, yes, then will probably be at least another week or so. These things probably don't move very fast. 28) Recieved an email stating that they are in negotiations with the top 3 candidates x3 29) Anyone accepted one of the positions? 30) I received an email that two people accepted.

What is required is a statement in the application package about a desire to learn French, which is generally interpreted as sincere because, after all, why would a non-French speaker apply to a francophone uni if they had no desire to learn French?

We welcome applicants who address fundamental evolutionary questions using integrative approaches and methods, in any system, including from organismal, genetic, and/or theoretical perspectives. 1) Does ""Chair"" mean the person is being hired to chair the department? Or is this just a fancy name for the appointment/endowment? I only ask because it seems weird to hire an Asst Prof as the chair of a department, right? 2) It is just an endowed/named professor position, it is not the department chair. 3) Realistically, is there any chance of this being appointed at the Asst Prof level? It seems very unlikely. 4) many other schools have ""chairs"" they award to Asst Profs in their 1-2 year at the institution, so maybe not unlikely if they end up going that route? 5) I got my PhD in this department, and I can say its a top-notch evolution destination. That said, this is a brand new endowed chair and I wouldn't be shocked if they hire an asst prof--the department values ECRs. I would encourage applications and see how it goes. 6) They are absolutely interested in the Asst Level. This chair comes with the title and a little money, and they are not necessarily looking for someone senior or fancy. 7) I don't recognize the acronym ECR.  Please help! :) 8) ECR = early career researcher :) 9) Agree with #5. Also got my PhD there.

We will ask for letters from referees of only those that make it to the first round (Zoom, no more than 10) OR maybe just the final 3-4 who we plan to invite for campus visits (beautiful campus). 5) thanks @2, are there traditional US academic ranks in your system (Asst, Assoc, Prof) or is it simply ""full time/permanent"" or not? 6) Anyone have insight on whether the ""split position"" policy means they don't do real spousal hires or could it differ if spouse is in a different department? 2) @5, there is no traditional ranking, in fact, no offical or unoffical ranking or seniority at all. @6 Spousal hires have been done before, there are current openings in Chemistry, Sculpture, Photography, and soon to be advertised in Computer Science. It is possability (especially for spouses that can teach CS!), I would bring it up if you make it to the first round of interviews. 11) I noticed instead of a teaching statement, the job wants : c) descriptions of three potential course offerings -- I've never done something like this before, any guidance? For example, on how long and how much detail to go into for each course? 12) @11 The admin is fixing that clerical error. We DO want to hear about your teaching philosophy, which is paramount at a place like Bennington. Three class descriptions could easily fit on one page. I would check out course descriptions for current classes online. And I will just say that Bennington is a place that celebrates bold, unique, and niche curricula and pedagogy. 13) A heads up that the application form requires both a ""CV"" and a ""Curriculum Vitae""—I had to upload mine twice in order to submit my application 14) There are so many keywords that align with my background for the curriculum and teaching you're looking for and I love innovative pedagogy. But I am really nervous about the long-term financial viability of a small, environmentally-focused school like this after the closure of Marlboro College and Green Mountain College. I was also laid off from a position I had at Unity College during the pandemic, and so were many of the long-term faculty with active research and teaching labs. Can the SC speak to the long-term financial viability of the college? I apologize for asking that in such a blunt way. 15) This university already instituted a very public and widely-derided series of budgetary layoffs of profs with ""presumptive tenure"" in the mid 1990s. 2) @13 thanks, HR has been notified, but it appears the problem persists. To get the system to accept an application you may have to upload the CV 2x @14 Understandable concern about many SLACs. This may not help, but let me point out a few things. I would not call Bennington an environmentally-focuses school, not in the STEM sense of environemtnally-focused. Bennington is most well known for their visual & performing arts and literature programs. The incoming class of 2021 and 2022 are the 2 largest in the school's history, early signs indicate that 2023 might be even bigger. Also, no Bennington faculty (permanent nor visiting) were let go or fired during the pandemic. 16) This is a basic questions, but is there a salary range for this hire? Also, during these reviews are there opportunities for raises? I am asking becuase I know that promotion between assistant, assocaite, and full professor are the only opportunity that most professors have for any kind of financial advancement through their career. 2) @16 I compared my starting salary from when I started to the SLAC salaries reported in the negotiation tab for that same season, and mine was at the 60th percentile, so competitive. I don’t actually know for sure what you should expect, but my ballpark estimate would be high 60’s to mid 70’s. Also, according to Google, Bennington, VT cost of living is 83.9 (US average=100), driven mostly by low cost of housing. Oppertunity for rasies that go beyond the yearly CofL increases happen one-on-one with the Provost office. Following reviews before new contracts are signed are an ideal time to do this at the faculty memeber's inititive. 17) 16 here again, thank you very much for the detailed information and being so open, I greatly appreciate it!  18) according to the national çenter for educational statistics asst prof avg $73,480 in 2020-2021.  MIT says the required annual income in Bennington county for one adult w no kids is $34,860; one adult w 1 kid is $69,950; 2 adults no kids is $56,373; 2 adults 1 kid is $65,533, 2 adults w 2 kids is $77,957.  soooo, your salary Will be near the minimum livable wage for that region if you have any kids and you won't have tenure.  make informed decisions. 19) HA! 18 tries to troll against Bennington but makes the case against academia altogether, mean US salary won't work in rural VT, it's not going to work most other places. 19) to 18.  you are either clueless or a liar. 2) I know many ask about this metric, so...1:8 We got 8 applications for every 1 selfreporting on ecoevojobs. 20) Interesting! Thank you for letting us know. 21) Wow, so 100 or so applicants? 22)@21 it was closer to 10 self reported applicants when @2 replied with that info, it has since increased. 23) @2 if you could let us know the number of applicants, that would protect against further changes in the denominator of the ratio ;) x2 2) @23, 88, so ~1:6 23) Any invites yet? 24) not yet 10/24 x3 25) still no updates? 26) not yet 11/8 27) I mean the department is like two people so it could take awhile :) 28) small dept sure... but we are approaching 2 months now 29) Yup. This one would be at the top of my list but I think I'm going to have to take something else. I know there were a lot of applicants and the chances that they would have been interested in me are small anyways, but it would have been nice to hear back before needing to accept something else! 30) my best guess is that they will start to make moves this week. I can imagine they have a lot going on so maybe a shorter week gave them the time necessary 31) It's been 2 months since the application deadline and still no one has heard anything? 32) nope 12/9 x5 33) references requested 12/12 x5 34) references and Zoom interview requested 12/12 x3 35) Strange, so some just got references requested while others got references requested and the Zoom interview invite? 35) wondering if SC can clarify-were the reference only emails in error? Or do you have two batches of candidates selected? 36) anyone have insight into what is going on here? Did the letter only people have their references contacted? 37) Today 38) anymore updates? have any of the references only people heard more about zoom interviews? when did the people with zoom requests schedule their interviews for (before or after holidays) ? 39) really? no one can answer @38?? 40) Had gotten an interview request on 12/12 but interview not scheduled yet. SC would need to clarify points 35-38, but yes, seems like there are two batch of candidates if some people didn't get an interview request. 41) I recieved a request for my reference writers' contact on 12/12 via an email that also stated I would be invited for a Zoom interview in Jan. Have not recieved any follow-up on that for scheduling. I will follow-up with them on Jan 3rd just to make sure I didn't miss or misinterpret anything if I haven't heard from anyone by then. Will let you know what I find out (12/27). 42) thank you! I am someone who received  reference requests on 12/12 but no zoom invite. I emailed on 12/21 to ask if there was an explanation or further details they could provide and I am awaiting a response. will update. 43) this is really absurd at this point. 44) Received email with zoom interview details 1/9 X 3 45) I received a zoom interview invite with details (I originally only had letters requested) 1/9 x2 46)Anyone invited for an on-campus interview? 47) I have not heard anything since the zoom interview (Feb 3) x2 48) Invited to campus — email sent out late in the evening on Feb 3 (x3) 49) Congrats 48s! 50) Out of curiousity was anyone offered the job? 50) Unofficial offer received on 3/31 51) https://twitter.com/CaitlinInMaine/status/1654081457738899456 ","16","Bennington College",FALSE,"VT",230816,"Bennington","Baccalaureate Colleges: Arts & Sciences Focus","Arts & sciences focus, some graduate coexistence","Postbaccalaureate: Other-dominant, with Arts & Sciences","Four-year, full-time, selective, lower transfer-in","High undergraduate","Four-year, very small, highly residential","Not Classified","New England CT ME MA NH RI VT","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Private not-for-profit",1,"Town Distant","No","No","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,254,46,0,0,0,300,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,44,2,223,31,0,0,826,901,799,738.333333,697,102,596,36,10,55,102,0,138,3,13,0,NA,NA,19,50,NA,114,0.38,38,4,2,0.052632,"Did not confer research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,1,3,0,765,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1382,829,0.599855,2

Some other searches have already been roasted over the coals for this policy this year (and every year). If you are reading this and it is at all within your power to change this, you absolutely should. It's partially an equity issue and in general over-burdens mentors. 4) it's thru academic jobs online, you can reuse reference letters to apply to multiple positions 5) @4, depends if your mentors have shared your letters with you, right? Also, many mentors think it's important to tailor their letters. 6) @4 even if they've shared letters with you, often search committees are asking for reference emails and then letters are automatically requested from mentors, so it doesn't matter if they've shared with you -- they still have to be the ones to upload letters! 7) Maybe just submit the application without the letters. If the SC likes what they see, maybe they'll ask for the letters and things can move along as if this silly requirement never existed. 8) The application won't be complete without reference letters in the system. I'm not sure if it means they won't get it or not. 9) Some HR departments and even faculty collective agreements require reference letters up-front. That should absolutely change but not including them if asked will probably result in an incomplete - whether or not that matters will vary quite a bit. 10) You have better odds applying to jobs with letters up front, as you can see it weeds out a lot of applicants. 11) @10, are you serious??? x4 12) it sucks but we all know people are still going to be applying for this opportunity. At least the competitive applicants wlll no matter what. 13) @12 uh...what! letters up front favors people who don't mind bugging their former mentors (who they probably are also better friends with... and probably also resemble), not necessarily the 'competitive applicants'. 13) just ""bug"" your mentors. it's not your faul the job asks for this. it really wint take yiur mentors TGAT much time to repurpose a letter and submit it. 14) Link says the job has expired even though deadline is October 21 (itomorrow)? 15) Argh, just spent ages working on my application for this. Anyone have a contact email? (16) There's no way the deadline will remain at Oct 21 with the obvious error in the application description. You can still apply through AcademicJobs, but many people will be turned away. 16) just hate these requesting letters up-front. will apps be reviewed if ref letters missing? 17) @16 depends on the school and the system, eg if HR doesn't pass along ""incomplete"" applications 18) I wonder what was the total amount of applicants to these positions maybe someone from inside could tell?, 19) There are sometimes analyses of correction factors for the number applied column on here. Seems to be around X10. My guess is > 300 apps on this one. 20) But also this is a ""biology"" search, so will also include molecular/cell and biomedical biologists. So could even be like 500?? In any case, A HUGE NUMBER. (21) It's well over 500 applicants. So cross your fingers and toes 22) then why the numbers applied is different (showing 38)? @21 that is just the number of people on this board who bothered to say they applied.  Typically there is ~10x more people who apply.  Plus this job is biology, not only eco-evo, hence the estimates that the number of apps is much greater. 23) any news? 24) not for me 11/14 x7 25) 550+ applicants, application review still underway 26) o_o x6 27) Got an email saying they were requesting letters from some candidates on 11/28 28) @27 Didn't this job require letters for the application? 29) <-- this isn't @27, but I uploaded letters up front; didn't get any email as of 11/28 27) Email said they were ""requesting actual reference letters from [their] selected applicants"" and asked to remind letter writers to upload by Dec 2 if they hadn't done so. 29) @27 maybe you received this email because one of your letter writers hadn't uploaded their letter yet? 30) Could be, in any case it measn theyre moiving forward. 30) This thread got really confusing. (31) Agree with (30),  has anyone who knows that all of their letters were uploaded in advance of the deadline heard anything? 32) They are just contacting people from their interediate list regardless of the status of their letters.  33) My letters were all uploaded in advance and I have not heard anything. I guess that means I didn't make whatever list they have moved on to? 34) My letters also went up in advance, and I have not heard anything; personally, I think we can't be sure that there is a new intermediate list yet-- it may just be an amalagam of manually collecting missing letters. However, WHO KNOWS! Lol. We will know when people post that they received an interview invite, I suppose. 35) Zoom interview invite received Dec 10 x6. 36) over 550 applications 37) @35 any further updates, only 5 invites?? 38) 20 invited for zoom. 39) curious about the invitees - are y'all mostly recent postdocs or have a few years under the belt? 40) @39 I got my PhD in 2014 and am in my 3rd pdoc. Ive had the most interest (zoom and full interviews) in the last 3 years. If Ive learned anything, the job search is crazy stochastic and you have to be the right ""fit,"" whatever that may mean to a given search committee, so try not to take the rejection too personally. Keep battling and good luck to you all! 41) thanks @40! Good luck! 42) @39 2nd year postdoc 43) @39 3rd year postdoc 44) rejection email 1/12 (X6) 45) On-campus invite x8 46) Has anyone heard anything? 47) Offers anticipated approx.

Big issues with not getting raises, salary compression, cost of living, etc. Basically, unless you have another source of money, it's gonna be hard to live here. I think salaries should be posted online somewhere since it is a public university. 2) Did the provost and chancellor both just leave? I saw an article about the chancellor leaving and it said their job would be handled by the interim provost? Does anyone know anything? 3) Search Committee here. I would counter what OP says, AVL is a fantastic place to live, and fantastic places to live tend to be more expensive. Everyone just got 5.5% raises from the state. Sure, there is compression, but challenge you to find many public unis without. Many places that are affordable are only 20 min commute, driving through beautiful mountains and not on 8 lane interstates. Provost and Chancellor left, but nothing unusual and no one is concerned. They both got sweet offers from giant foundations. A good sign that we attract really outstanding leadership and they sometimes get poached. It is part of the normal admin churn at any uni. Provost and Chancellor lifespan at any uni is about 5 years, that is how long the chancellor was here. We have a lot of fantastic people here, outstanding students, this is a really great place. 4) Are there any updates on this position? 5) Invited for Zoom interview 11/10.  5) Any word about on-campus interviews @5?  6) @5 here.

It also seems possible that maybe for some of the positions, if the search committee is interested in the potential of the applicant but doesn't quite see they level of experience expected, they might not hire them immediately into a TT position but be willing to hire at a postdoc level. 6) JMU Bio faculty here. Not on the committee and these are just my opinions, but I would say that the general ethos with these cluster hires has been to cast as wide a net as possible. They are looking quite broadly and considering synergy potential among the current pool of applicants as well as the recent hires made in AY 2021-22. All recent searches have been broad here in CSM.

""I have a strong commitment to learn French"". Somehow I doubt that. Non-French speakers should apply with extreme caution 4) Probably the same way they judge other components of the application. Definitely apply with caution, but if you've been studying French for years and just need a bit of immersion to truly unlock fluency consider, ""I have a strong commitment to learn French and this is how I plan to do that."" similar to how you write your research and mentorship plans. 5) A friend who got interviewed for this search last year had no French, but could demonstrate that they had learned another foreign language during their postdoc abroad - I guess this was sufficient to demonstrate commitment/ability to learning a language required for a job. 6) Can someone on the search committee be transparent about the odds for a non-french speaker? These apps take time and I do not want to waste mine applying for a position that would never really consider me. I certainly would be committed to learn French, though. 7) you would almost certainly be expected to teach in French for undergraduate courses. I would not bother applying if you have never studied French at even a basic level...unless you have something more convincing to say than I'm excited about this job. 8) I was in this department as an anglophone/allophone postdoc. A serious commitment to learning French is obviously important, but there are professors on the faculty whose background is very anglophone. As someone mentioned above, anglophones have made it to the interview stage in recent searches and given their talks in English. But besides teaching, you may not feel fully a part of the departmental community until you have good conversational French. 9) @5 your friend wasn't hired so... that commitment clearly wasn't enough to make it through 5) @9 They dropped out of the search to take a different opportunity. In any case, final offers can be made or not made to a given applicant for any number of reasons...but they fact that they interviewed someone with no French seems like relevant information for others here asking if French fluency is an absolute pre-requisite...  10) Previous search for this position did not fail b/c someone dropped out though 11) TT faculty member here, not on SC. I was recently hired despite speaking zero french (A1 level, no prior 2nd language experience), and the other 3 shortlisted candidates were in the same boat. Also, the dept.'s most recent TT hire (cross-appointed with other dept.) also speaks zero french. So the dept. is entirely open to hiring non-french speakers and has a recent precedent of doing so. All interview steps are conducted in english and the uni offers an intensive french-learning program for as long as is necessary. What is required is merely a statement in the application package about having a desire to learn french. This is generally interpreted as sincere because, tbh, why would a non-french speaker apply to a francophone uni if they had no desire to learn french? So the bar for convincing the SC of this is pretty low (though it is helped by things like a french-speaking family member, prior 2nd language experience, etc). Also, all faculty, pretty well all students, and most staff speak english, so it's always an option in unofficial settings despite french being the default language. And fwiw, everyone (faculty, students, staff, deans, etc) has been very patient and supportive with me as I learn the language. However, tbh, it can be stressful (esp. teaching en français) and, as @8 says, can result in relatively slow dept. assimilation. But I suspect this will vary depending on personality type.  11) Treat it as a non-wnglish speaker applying for a job in Anglophone North America? 12) @11, maybe easier than that because the large majority of people at U of Montreal speak english too. 11) Absolutely, and people very understanding of non-native speakers, which is often not the case in Anglophone places 12) Search committee had to be reorganized due to too many confilcts of interest, so could be some time on this one  13) 2 failed searches in a row for this position is not a good look 13) did the first search also fail because of conflicts of interest? 14) I don't think this search is failed per se, they plan to reorganize and hire still for the fall. First search failed because someone accepted the position and then backed out at a very late stage. 15) name and shame plz 16) any updates? 17) I haven't heard anything yet (as of 1/23) x3 18) Still nothing as of 1/30 x4 17) Does anyone have any idea on timelines here?

The search committee understands the complaints and will take them into consideration in the future, but the short statements do allow more members of the department to have a say in the initial ""cut"" of applicants, which helps avoid biases by the search committee. 3) Moderators please update the Review date to 10/7/2022 4) 1-3 pg statements, skimmed, are reasonably short. obviously this adds up with lots of applicants. but making judgements based on 200 word statements seems more flawed to me. especially since people are throwing these together, perhaps quickly, since this is one of the few applications requiring these! 5) Any word on this one? 6) @5 I have not received any correspondence about my application yet. However, I attended a talk by UAF fac/curator yesterday who said they believe the SC is possibly looking for a senior scientist, regardless of it being advertised at the Assis Prof level. I think this was based on the fact that they have been headhunted for several other curator positions across the US, some of which also advertised at the Assis Prof level, despite them already having full tenure. 7) @6 weird to post speculation from some rando at a different institution... 8) I would think that--if they already knew they might want senior prof--the ad would have been written to hire at any level.

Another ad here requires a short video! 7) I've heard this place expects the equivalent of 2 R01 for tenure 8) I know for a fact that #7's claim is wrong. Yes, UW Biology will want grants for tenure (what R1 doesn't?), but amt, from where, will depend on subject matter and so on. It's a very broad department, and candidates for tenure are viewed holistically. 9) From SC member: @2. now posted on CHE and APS; @3+. Our recent searches have used the short statements to get more reviewer eyes on each application, which we hope improves the process without being too onerous to applicants;  @7+9. The UW Biology department emphasizes good science for tenure and doesn't dwell on the mechanics of doing the science. We want jr faculty to excell and there's certainly no expectation for 2 RO1. 10) @9, thanks for the info, but if you want some honest feedback from applicants: having weird format/extra short statements is a huge burden on applicants who are generally underpaid and in precarious empoyment. x8. 11) Agreed with 10, although I like the idea of short statements (saves time for applicants and reviewers). It would be cool if candidates who made the medium or short list were then invited to send longer statements. 12) Reply from 9: @10, thanks for the feedback, which I'll pass along. The statements also allow for additional review without the identifying info in the cover letter. 13) Just FYI, the questions for the brief statements are slightly different between the posting and the Interfolio application..... 14) The ad was updated to specify review will start 10/7 (which is due to some logistics). 14) Seriously, instead of spending the afternoon with my kids I had to write bespoke 200-word versions of statements I've already spent a year (and many other afternoons) working on. Do better. 15) Then don't apply. The entitlement about requirements this years is getting so annoying. What about the search committe members time with their kids? UW always has a high number of applications so it makes sense that they limit word counts so they can actually take a look at everyone. x2 also, lol @14 spending time commenting on this instead  - wait for it - of spending time with their kids 16) Maybe committee members could review applications in their offices during working hours, as it's their job. 17) @15, no. What makes sense is making the position sufficiently defined that your appllicant pool is basically 50-100 applications instead so broad everyone and their dog applies.  Frankly, the top 5-10% of any pool is composed of indistinguishable candidates with whoever screws up getting excluded. 18) Any updates? x2 19) I have heard that the diversity statement is screened elsewhere in the institution, by people not on the actual search committee.

Last time around there were literally 3+ different advertisements posted with conflicting information.  Although the position says t here is an option for tenure, during the interview it was clear there was no intention of tenure being granted to anyone.  Second, it says collaborate on teaching, you will not be teaching anything.  This is again very poorly represented. There were other things that were clearly misrepresented in the advertisement last time around, but I have forgotten most as I moved on.  THE GOOD: The faculty were amazingly nice.  I got a distinct vibe they were frustrated with the way the advertisement was written, suggesting it was administratively altered from what they wanted.  But NOBODY said that, it is purely a vibe at my end.  Despite the Bad, I would have taken it as it seemed like a really good positions with good faculty, good pay and benefits, and in a reasonable cost of living area.  So, I felt the good outweighed the bad.  I will not be reapplying for it as I saw who they campus interviewed last time around, and they were clearly in a different fold than me. The QUESTIONABLE: the biggest red flag for me was that the spouse of the search chair last year is the asst director of the center.  Since she IS NOT on the search committee (unheard of in my book), she clearly must be a candidate.  I will guess she did not rank among the final group.  It is hard to believe that they were unable to fill this vacancy last year.  In fact, during my interview there was a off the breath, unintentional comment that they would do interviews and then start all over again.  This raises the suspicion on my part that the faculty want her, but admin want someone else.  Again, the questionable here is 100% speculation on my part.  I encourage you to apply because the advertisement looks way more defined this time around and as I said, I would have taken it.  But, I have a rule that if you invite me for a telephone interview and don't bring me in you lost your chance, especially when my CV is better than anyone on staff. ;).  I bet they know who wrote this if they are checking the page! Oh well! :). 2). was offered this position last time it was advertised, but I had to turn it down because I was not able to negotiate a spousal hire (Spousal hires are out of the norm for their campus, although some other UW campuses do it). I got a really good vibe from the faculty and staff I met with while there, and I think I would have really liked the position. I was disappointed to turn it down. The advertisement was a bit confusing, but during the campus visit I got some clarity. This is a primarily administrative position, running/promoting the center and facilitating the research of faculty, but not running your own research lab.  Teaching was not a primary part of the position, but it did seem some tropical field courses during the winter session may be possible. The previous director had two roles - a regular faculty member and the administrative director position.  Their plan was to split his position into two, so they would eventually hire another faculty member to teach his courses, and this director position would focus solely on the more administrative tasks.  This in combination with the search committee coming from a broad swath of the university (faculty, staff at the center, university advancement, facilities management, etc.) probably explains why the expectations weren't entirely clear in the advertisment.  For the tenure piece, they said this would have to go through a review first, ensuring you met their tenure requirements, and would generally happen about a year in and would give you retreat rights. I talked to adminstrators from a couple of other universities, and was told that this isn't uncommon, although it would have been disconcerting to leave a tenured position without a guarantee. I didn't get the sense that there was an inside candidate, although I wondered about that before I actually went to campus. Long story short - if you think you would enjoy a more administrative role and don't need a spousal hire, I wouldn't hesitate to apply for this position. 3). the search committee chair is married to I another prof in same program.  I know other faculty in other departments.  they can do spousal hires.  typical of admin - faculty conflict.  I saw the names brought in.  you would have been a great hire.  as I and you said, it seems like a good job.  btw, I was told point blank it wasn't getting tenure.  any normal vacancy will set applicant standards such that tenure is granted automatically upon a 1 yr preliminary period.  the more I think about what I was told compared to what you  are relaying, the more I'm glad I didn't end up there.  they are clearly rushing into an advertisement without sufficient forethought.  it reminds me of a trainwreck I was once associated with.  lots of people making plans with no real experience or competency to do so.  don't mistake this for bitterness.

I am very confused about this LOR situation. 24) I submitted my application on 10/25, and my references were contacted for letters on 10/29; since review isn't supposed to start til 11/1, maybe they are just requesting them all manually, or there's a delay in the automatic request system. 25) They ARE requesting LOR from the onset.  There's a few days of delay between submitting and the requests, so they might have some initial screening, but they aren't waiting for a short list (I though this was very misleading in their advert) x2 26) Welp so much for that application. I totally thought letters were NOT due upfront. x5 27) After submitting my application (right at the review deadline), it said that I had until 11/4 to update materials, and my letter writers were contacted. I don't know if they were given a date to get letters in by. For whatever this info is worth to folks. 28) I know a PI who is writing letters for to different people for this job, and they were contacted on different days about them (11/5 and 11/6). Seems like it is being done manually. Oof. 29) It is definitely being done manually by someone in the department, I've seen the email they have to send out. Double oof. 30) I don't understand about the LOR supposedly being sent out by hand. My LOR were something sent out automatically when I started my application? 31) One of my letter writers told me that the LOR requests didn't include a deadline. 32) @31 hope that's true because one of mine didn't get sent until this week 33) @32 - Whoa! It's quite the system they have going on there.  34) If LORs are requested by a search member, they are more likely to be curated than if an admin is sending them all by hand.  Anybody have info on that?  My letters were requested ~2 days after submission, before the deadline.  35) @34, the email address the request came from belongs to an EEB administrator (one of my refs forwarded me the request so I could see it); if letter requests are curated, then it's probably only insofar as they check that you followed the application instructions before requesting references 36) In the webinar they said that a shortlist would be contacted mid-late Dec. They probably received 300+ applications (900 letters manually requested) so it makes sense if it would take a while. 37) Postdoc in the department here: I've heard that ~270 applications were received. (38) Interesting, it's the same as U Virginia. (39) Any news? 3-dec-22 (40) Nothing here x4 (41) Department postdoc here. Seems like they are starting campus interviewing candidates this week. (42) @41 Are they sending invites this week or are they starting the campus interviews already? Are they going to invite (or have invited) candidates for Zoom interviews first? (43) 41 again. I was not involved in the process. I just heard that a candidate will giving his/her job talk today in person. Sorry that I do not know more inforamtion. Hopefully this helps. (44) Thank you @43! So, they're already inviting people for on campus interview. That's fast! (45) Seems odd that nobody from this board was contacted for an interview...46) Didn't they say interveiws were in January at the webinar? Perhaps the candidate who spoke today is being considered for a different position? 47) 41 again. @46, that's possible, I am not sure. Apologies for the confusion if this is the case. (48) @41 no problem! Any info is useful! Thanks for sharing. At the webinar they said the short list would be out mid-/late-December and the interviews would be Jan/Feb. I believe they didn't mention Zoom interviews but I might be wrong. (49) Any invitation yet for in person interviews? any update on whether the event discussed in the previous comment was the official inverview? (50) Have heard early career interviews (ie asst level hires) have not yet started (51) On-campus interview invitation (am postdoc) X3 (52) Rejection received by email 01/24 x3 (53) I never received a rejection or an invite. x3 (02/1)  54) Just received an email that sounds like I'm on some kind of backup list for interviews, but it's difficult to tell if that is real. x4 (02/01) 55) the email I got was along the lines of 'we're not inviting you so it's over, but it may not be over.' Appreciate getting an update. 56) I also got a non-rejection letter.  Sounds like we are the backup list if things fall though (which is very common with open rank searches). 57) Got a back-up list email, too - is there any timeline for back-up interviews? (48) Two offers were made; rejection after interview with chance for offer if someone declines. 49) Any updates by chance?  Has anyone on the backuplist heard anything? (58) Sounds like offers have gone out and I wouldn't get my hopes up if I am on back up list with no interview? (59) I'm in the backup list and never hear from the chair of the SC since early February. x3 (60) What did they say in Feb? Sounds like it was a backup (61) Does anyone have updates? Are all positions filled? The announcement is still up and was even updated. (62) They have made offers and chosen back up candidates from the interview list. (63) I'm on the backup list but I haven't heard anything since February. I was wondering if anyone else had heard anything at all?  Any updates? (63)  I'm assuming these positions are filled, but I still haven't heard anything (I'm on the backup list). (64) @62 Any updates? (65) I'm a peron on the backup list and I still have not recieved a rejection or any correspondence.  One would think they would thank us for our application and say the position is closed..... (66) Did anyone take the job? Am hearing that first two offers might have declined.  (67) @66 Do you know roughly when the first two offers declined? Could mean this one is still a possibility. 68) https://twitter.com/paleoTsimoes/status/1672237892733898758","22","Princeton University",FALSE,"NJ",186131,"Princeton","R1 Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity","Arts & sciences plus professions, high graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Comprehensive programs, no medical/veterinary school","Four-year, full-time, more selective, lower transfer-in","Majority undergraduate","Four-year, medium, highly residential","Not Classified","Mid East DE DC MD NJ NY PA","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Private not-for-profit",1,"City Small","No","No","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,1268,602,318,0,0,2188,382414,14088,889,799,52,71,189,6,312,6,495,107,959,309,0,0,8419,8532,7853,7796.333333,4774,3079,4688,0,1,85,3079,0,1146,0,12,0,NA,NA,17,45,NA,372,0.170018,35,82,33,0.942857,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,1,16,16,5113,816,524,710,740,1450,32,32,32,32835,1848,0.056281,3

The faculty seemed nice and the new program they are starting really excited me because it is similar to the one that I am currently involved with. I think ETSU has a lot going for it, and I was pretty excited by the possibility to work there. Hopefully it will work out. Did you visit as well? 4?5?) I also interviewed and agree with all of this. Good opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a rebuilding department and really influence the direction of an exciting new curriculum. People were all really nice and genuinely seem happy. 6) glad to hear it.  I've always had a good vibe about that school. (FYI, i was the one who asked how it went). 7) Has anyone been contacted following the on campus interviews? 8) Nothing here 9) I suppose the other person recieved the offer. I haven't ben contacted either. 8 again) That would be my guess. They told me there might be unexpected delays in the offer process due to HR needing to do their thing, but I am thinking probably it's the other person who got the offer. 10) Offer made and unofficially accepted. They are drafting the contract now. 11) Good to know! Congratulations to the (likely) new hire, and to ETSU for getting someone they're happy with.12) Congratulations!

Brief online search gives me a weird vibe. Is this a (de facto) for-profit institution? Is anyone familiar with it? 2) Not personally familiar, but looks pretty typical for a smaller, private and non-profit University.  It's been around for 170+ years and is rank in US News etc. 3) how does the cost of living compare to the salary? According to CHE, full professors there make ~$85k, so seems like it'd be a challenge in the Portland area 4) it's a SLAC. Biology Dept is within an undergrad-only college with around ~1400 students. 5) is it really a ""SLAC"" given its acceptance rate is around 90%? 6) Some comments (I went to undergrad in Portland). Forest Grove is reasonably outside of Portland that cost of living is much lower. Pacific University doesn't have the selectivity of Reed or Lewis and Clark but it's a reputable small liberal arts school. 6) Ya'll, the S in SLAC = small, not selective, don't be snarky x5 7) @6, it's about 50/50 small or selective depending on who you ask! <-- in 20+ years of higher ed faculty teaching, I have NEVER heard of an SLAC referred to as anything but SMALL. 8) https://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/SLAC Of course most of the time when people use it they don't spell out what they mean, so I'd guess a lot of people just assume whoever is talking shares a definition. Plus, Pacific University isn't particularly small or selective. 9) I would 100% call ~1400 students small 10) Wikipedia lists it at 4000 students. US News categorizes it as a national or regional university for rankings. 11) Any updates?

It's unclear from the ""Application materials required"" list at the end. Thanks! 5) Does anyone know if UBC offer faculty housing? Is vancouver affordable to live in otherwise? 6) @5 Canadian here - I don't know about faculty housing but Vancouver is a very expensive city to live in @5 yes, there is affordable faculty housing on the beautiful campus. 7) @2 the zoology and botany depts are somewhat historical, so plenty of ecologists in the zoology dept work on plants. 8) Mythical dept for evo/eco here, feels kinda intimidating to even apply 9) Search committee member here - @2- not necessarily! @3 yes, this is typical of Canadian searches, but we have hired many non-Canadians in past searches @4 letters will be requested at the long-listing stage, we are asking for contact details with the application @5 UBC offers subsidized housing on campus for faculty and assists in the purchase of a home @8 I hope you apply! 10) "" to address fundamental aspects of evolution."" So not seeking for ecological research? @10 correct, this is an Evolution, not Ecology search. @9 Can you tell us if UBC Biology will be doing any more searches this or next year?  @@9 UBC Zoology doesn't have any other searches planned at the moment - not sure about Botany or other relevant departments. 11) I'm wondering what the typical teaching load is like in Canada? (Is it equivalent to US R1s?) @11 yes, equivalent. 12) Is this another case of when they say they want a diversity candidate but end up picking a white person anyways? @12 where do they say they want a racialized candidate? they list several areas of diversity - ""sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, racialization, disability, political belief, religion, marital or family status, age, and/or status as a First Nation, Metis, Inuit, or Indigenous person"" not just racialized. 13) @9 Are you able to weigh in on preferred research area? 14) what on earth is a ""diversity candidadte"" or a ""racial candidate""? 15) So on AJO, there is the option to request letters for the position, but the ad seems to suggest it's not letters upfront, and also you're asked to upload contact info for references. So, anyone have any insight as to what to do here? Does the request letters thing just show up because I've applied to things through AJO before? 16) @9 could you update us with how many applicants you get? 17) Any news on this? 18) No, as of Nov. 24. x9 19) any updates? 25/11 20) Received email from admin asking me to send letter requests through the AJO system on 11/25.

They never told us why and just gave us generic responces when pressed. Communication was attrotious from the beginning - we only got our time slot days before, emails went frequently unanswered for lengthy periods etc...we also had a mix of candidates from North America and Germany - they put all the North American candidates in the morning (German time) so no regard for time zones or anything. Bonn is supposedly meant to be a 'good' university, but this whole experience - the complete lack of respect in the way the department treated us early career researchers left a really bad taste in my mouth.

So I +1 for letters but not for applied. Faulty data point here lol 8) 10 for 10 you mean.  Sounds like they requested from everyone?  That or we are just the 10 greatest every! :) 9) 11 Greatest now! 10) FYI, I reported a letter request above, but not that I'd applied... for anyone running a model. 10) I hate to admit it, but it looks certain that they requested letters from everyone. I don't think this indicates much in terms of screening. Seems like we'll have to wait and see who makes it to the firt interview round. 11) @10 - yea, maybe. But also, I think there's an obvious bias in who is reporting on their applications on this website. 12) I also was asked for a letter and hadn't previously reported myself here as an applicant. It is starting to seem like they asked for letters from everyone. 13) @12 if so, I would have preferred they didn't say ""congratulations, you made it to the next round."" and interfolio saying letters requested from ""semi-finalists"" ... unless the pool is just that small ?? 14) I just added myself, I had not seen this position posted here. Letters were requested too, so I think we're at 13/13 for letters? 15) @11 what do you think the bias is? neurotic & competitive (me x3) ? 16) I think the bias is that people with something to report, report! But I agree, it looks like they asked for letters from everyone. Despite the ""congratulations!"" email... 17) I can't speak for everyone, but I report when I don't get something on this job board, I know this is true of my job seeking colleagues as well. Requesting this many letters, particularly spread across several days, seems to be an indication that they invited all of us. Perhaps a mistake made early on that now has to be rectified? Anyone feel like reaching out to ask? 18) At this point, seems like we can all just wait. Learning whether they asked letters from everyone or not won't necessarily be helpful for anything (an update, a friend participated in a previous search there where they were very transparent and communicative about these, and he said they asked for letters from 20 people, and 10 of those went on to online interviews) 19) i also always report either way; but I kind of disagree with @18 -- i think it matters whether the ""congratulations"" meant anything at all 20) 18 here. My bad, I didn't mean to be dismissive. I meant from a practical sense it doesn't change things, letter writers have all submitted their letters already. 21) all good. that makes sense. 22) any news. they said review will begin on 11/8. 23) Nothing here 11/17 x8 24) More like ""Nothing here, but I still check this every day, multiple times a day just in case"" x2 25) invited for a 30 minute zoom interview 11/28 x4 26) the email about zoom interviews said 13 people are getting zoom interviews -- if we were 13/13 for letter requests, we could be 13/13 for zoom interviews too haha! x2 27) Did not get an email about a zoom interview :(... so there's one data point. x6 28) so are we thinking if we didn't hear yesterday that's it? if so, what a coincidence about the 13 invitations... wonky ride. 29) no notice here yet either, but one of my references had issues with the system and had to contact HR.

Obviously they're trying to fill a particular role (which is completely fair), but why have two seperate calls? Are there two different committees reviewing? 2) Yes, entirely different committees. The Biologist position scope is broader and specifically not limited to ecological research. The two calls reflect needs and opportunities in aquatic systems in the dept/uni. 3) This reads like they want a fish person that does food webs. 4) Any news? 5) I haven't heard anything yet 6) Seems like the Ohio State searches are moving pretty slow 7) This wait is so frustrating! 8) Anything? 9) Campus invites went out earlier this week 10) oh skipped zoom interviews?? 11) Yes, there will be no zoom interviews for any of these positions, all straight to campus.

Why would they do that? 2) there are always at least two employment lines for these jobs, a non-competitive line and a competitive line for the lack of a better word. The link you are referring to takes you to the non-competive line. The line that is open to the public can be found here  (https://www.usajobs.gov/job/670731900). 3) This was advertised last spring. I guess it failed for some reason? 4) Yes, a few of the AUL searches failed last cycle before any interviews were conducted, this was one of them. 5) Thanks 4. Do you know why they failed? 5) Veteran applicants 6) Why would veteran applicants make the searches fail?  7) not affliated with this search, but it could be the case that with veterans preference points, those applications went to the top of the pile at the first cut---not necessarily done by someone with any technical knowledge---and in the end the candidates were actually unqualified. I'm pro-veterans preference for federal jobs, but this can sometimes be a consequence.8) I believe the one this spring was for the unit leader, while this is for an assistant unit leader. 9) This is the same position from the spring. 6) #5 - do you know for a fact that this was the specific issue or are your making an assumption, here? There are other classes of non-federal employees who also have preference. Veteran's preference will only get you 'referred to the hiring manager' for these higher-level research positions - it's up to the hiring manager and coopeartors to choose who they bring in for interviews. Veterans cannot ""bump"" another qualified individual from the pool of resumes that are sent to a hiring manager (though this is different for postions at lower GS levels). These searches fail for a number of different reasons including disagreement among coopeators working with the specific Unit. Curious why you specifically thought 'Veteran applicants' was the reason this search failed. 10) Institution should be USGS, not University of Maine x2 11) @9 your understanding of how the veteran's preference works is incorrect, see the corresponding section here (https://jabberwocky.weecology.org/2021/06/14/usajobs-guide/) for a more accurate description. In brief, if a singular veteran is deemed qualified, no one can be considered unless the individual in question turns the job down. When faced with a situation where only a single candidate can be considered, SC have been failing the search prior to interviews. 12) @6, here - I'm a diabled veteran (and tenured faculty) who has applied to half a dozen of these positions, interviewed for 2, and not selected for any of them. I do know those who were selected for those postions did not have veterans preference. As I mentioned earlier in this post, veterans are alowed to apply to these federal-only positions because I have veterans preference - it does not guarantee an interview or a job offer (this would be different for a non-science or research job at lower GS levels). The hiring guidelines outlined by OPM and linked by @11 indicate that the hiring process is different for research positons. 12) another fed researcher here- for research potsitions there are often multiple certs... @11 is correct, but you can often pull a different cert if there's wonky vet stuff going on. If no additional certs and vet isn't a match for the job, it's often a close and re-ad, but I've also seen vets negotiate and then turn down, which also causes a failed search when the federal cert expires and you spent your time on a candidate that turns you down. 13) This search DID NOT FAIL last year. They hired someone: https://www1.usgs.gov/coopunits/staff/2289995 A new position opened because the previous co-op unit leader (who was the only one working on wildlife rather than fish) recently became the supervisor for the northeast and upper midwest cooperative reseach units. As a result, they now have 2 fish people and no wildlife people, and an opening.  14) There was a search this Spring that apparently failed (AFTER last year's hire that 13 is referring to above) 15) @6 veterans preference no longer counts above the GS12 level. The jobs you interviewed for but did not get above a non-veteran must have been GS13 or above. 16) Any updates? 17) Just got this for both GS12 and GS13: ""There are other applicants who, by law, must be considered before your application, such as displaced federal employees, certain Veterans, and others entitled to special consideration. Therefore, your application will not be considered at this time."" 18) Same here as @17 3x 19) Zoom interview 1/5/23 20) I was just referred out of the blue for this position after initially being not referred due to other qualified applicants with special consideration. Does anyone know what is happening with this search? x2 21) Zoom interview 3/24 after referred out of the blue also, did they have a failed early round in Jan? x3 22) offer was made but not accepted in Jan; 23) sounds like the timeline is pretty tight (end of April for accepted offer) x2 24) any updates?

The people I know who went to PC as students were not religious. I am an ex-Catholic and I'm applying to another position at PC, so I'm interested to see what others have to say.  3) Spring search was for VAP/adjunct positions so this is a new search! Many students and faculty at PC are not religious and/or a religion other than Catholic. 4) While the current employees are probably very accepting and not that religious, if asked during an interview about your religious affiliation or interest, my experience around other religiously affiliated universities tells me that there is, in fact, a right answer. 5) Faculty member in the department chiming in to say that few of us are religious, and that's perfectly fine as long as you can tolerate writing a response to the mission statement that addresses faith and reason as compatible, and as long as you're okay with super big crucifixes, it's a thing. Besides that stuff, we're always trying to be a more inclusive and welcoming department to students from all walks of life. 6) thanks @5 for the insight! x2 7) References got requests but I think it must be automatic from the online system because it was day after I applied? Anyone else get this? 8) @7, yes I got this too and my writers have been submitting letters (not sure they are supposed to though!) 7) @8 thanks for confirming. why must these application systems toy with us?

AFAIK no one has heard anything from PC yet this cycle (across all 3 jobs). 13) Thank you @14! 15) Last night I googled ""Providence College"" to see if I could find any news about financial issues, budget cuts, etc. that may explain why there's been radio silence on all three jobs. I found this article on the second or third page of results: https://www.thefire.org/news/mere-hours-after-fire-letter-providence-college-drops-termination-proceedings-against-biology this could explain some things. it's also very much a red flag. 16) @15 YIKES! Thank you for finding and sharing that. That makes me think this is not a good fit for me. 17) WOW thanks for sharing @15, this is terrible and also raises a MAJOR red flag! x2 18) Agreed, MAJOR red flag.

Orth is Fish & Wildlife Conservation. This is in Biological Sciences. 7) Thanks 6, not being familiar with the current or future identities/visions of the different departments, is a specialty in stream ecology/imperiled fish & aquatic taxa of interest to Biological Sciences? I should have specified regardless of department you may not be seeking similarities in specialties across departments (esp. w/ Angermeier & Frimpong on campus as well). I ask out of genuine interest in the position and to best serve the imperiled taxa I study. Best regards. 8) @SC, what about non-fungi microbes?? 9) We're not ruling anything out. Fish are great. Yes, we do have a department of Fisheries and Wildlife Conservation at VT, but if you think of yourself of as an organismal biologist, go ahead and apply. As for microbes, we included ""animals, plants, and fungi"" in the job description because we have a microbiology section of the department, and we just did a microbiology search last year. But again, I'd say apply if you consider yourself an organismal biologist. -SC 9) Will letters be requested immediately upon application or later in the process? x2 10) Later -SC 11) Thanks for the clarification, SC, 12) I am guessing this ad got ~300 apps. 13) 311 applications.

Or only initally review those submitted by Oct 1st? 20) I'm so unspecial that I am special, especially when my specialty is specializing in especially specific specializations. 21) Anyone has gotten intimated about referee letter requests? 22) with 311 applicants, I'm guessing they are still working on making the short list. I suspect it's early still for letter requests. 23) I've seen openings with bigger turnouts (>500) request letters withing a couple of weeks... 24) Maybe so but a longer turnaround time suggests VT is actually looking at applications rather than skimming to find the people with Nature papers. 25) We are still in the first round of review right now. It will be a while before requests for letters go out. @19, we will continue to look at applications that come in late. Only had a few after 10/1, but they are all on our list to review. -SC 26) any news? x11 27) Still reading applications. Hoping to do Zoom interviews by the end of the month, but we'll see. -SC 28) thank you for the update, SC! x7 29) Letter requests should go out to a long list soon, probably by the end of the week. No Zoom interview invitations will go out until after Thanksgiving. -SC 30) thanks for keeping us informed, SC!  Definitely helps with the stress of this whole process. x3 31) Received email saying letters were requested 11/19. x15 32) Apprently they received 300 applicants and are still actively going through documents, while requesting LOR as they go 32) @31, what makes you say that?

I'm a former employee of this department, and my experience working here was negative. I experienced harassment and bullying from my supervisor, and observed graduate students being treated similarly. A professor in this department is under investigation for research misconduct, and the department has covered up and ignored problematic behavior in the past. I regret working here; there are good people in this department, but my time here exemplified academic toxicity. As for the faith aspect, faculty are expected to maintain a religious affiliation, but it does not have to be Baptist. Faculty candidates are expected to make a verbal expression of faith at some point during the interview process, and then demonstrate that (e.g., log worship attendance) if hired. 2) I applied to this position last year and can confirm they will ""Faculty candidates are expected to make a verbal expression of faith at some point during the interview process, and then demonstrate that (e.g., log worship attendance) if hired"". I was asked to confirm what parish or church I attend, how often, etc. To be transparent, I was told they would ask but I was also told that it wouldn't be a big deal. Just a few questions that would never matter. I was also told that being a part of the LGBTQIA+ community would be welcomed. However, prior to in-person I was sent an email stating this : ""Frankly, we are still challenged with these issues within our faculty. For example, would you be comfortable in an environment where BU-PP-031 states: “Baylor will be guided by the biblical understanding that human sexuality is a gift from God and that physical sexual intimacy is to be expressed in the context of marital fidelity. Thus, it is expected that Baylor students, faculty and staff will engage in behaviors consistent with this understanding of human sexuality.” This policy (which dates back to 1963) can impose a barrier for some prospective faculty since it still holds for faculty members. The second area concerns tenure. I want to make sure that you would be comfortable with Baylor’s current expectation that all faculty being considered for tenure have a personal involvement with a local faith community."". So to be clear, if you are a LGBTQIA+, alley, or non-religous please beware of this AD and university/department 3) Yikes x20 4) Sounds like a nightmare 5) I honestly hope they get few applications X3. 6) Really appreciate sharing your experience #2. x3 5) The only faith community I am personally involved with is this job board. x7 7) Former postdoc in the Biology department here. I want to let people know that I’ve have knowledge of the points above; however, I want to provide a slightly different perspective. My postdoc advisor had one of the largest labs in the department and it was healthy and extremely diverse. He was also an extremely vocal ally for the LGBTQIA+ community. My everyday work life felt very similar to being at a secular institution. I am not particularly religious and the university’s religious affiliation rarely, if ever, affected my job. I think the university is making (albeit slow) progress in moving to a better place for the LGTBQIA+ community. If the points brought up by 2 & 3 aren’t deal breakers, consider applying and help bring the change that I feel most of the students and faculty want. 8) The search committee would be happy to discuss these issues or other concerns with anyone interested to know more about this or other positions at Baylor. Please see the email listed in the job post. 9) Any updates? 10) In person interviews are being scheduled for Feb. 11) Any update on whether an offer was made here?

It is a waste of all the letter writers' time if you get 200+ applications x12 5) SC - we've looked into this repeatedly, with all upstream steps and relatively early interviews we only have ~1 week where they could be requested in between long and short list, which seems unreasonable to candidates and writer 6) @SC so your answer instead is to demand for maybe 500 PIs to write letters, many for applications you will dismiss out of hand? Your solution should have been to alter YOUR review schedule to have more than a week between lists, not to burden applicants and their support. x16 7) I'd love to be in the department, but I have a strict no upfront letter of rec policy - I already have a tenured job, so I'm just not going to apply.x7 8) Having served on search committees elsewhere, this is sometimes dictated by HR/the application software/external timelines (as here), not the members. I'd think you shouldn't shoot the messenger, who is clearly trying to help. 9) @8  fair point about shooting the messenger, but it should be noted that Faculty have more power here than you are giving them credit for, and absolutely CAN enact a change if they see good reason to advocate for it. Having the job boards tell them unequivocally that this is a very unpopular policy is valuable. x3 10) Grad student salary = ~$31K, MIT living wage = $34K, one of the best in the public sector. @7 Glad to hear those with tenured positions aren't applying - can you please wait a few years for the sake of the postdocs out there struggling to make ends meet while you play musical chairs with the very limited jobs bc of the pandemic? x8 11) @8, the committee member above seems to specify that this isn't an HR requirement but rather a choice of the committee. 12) SC - the requirement for letters up front was not the committee's choice. We argued against it but were told it was not up to us. @SC make sure you tell administration that you lost significant strong applicants because of their policy. Also this recent comment doens't seem to match what the previous SC comment about looking into upstream steps. There was clearly a dialogue there. Tell them next time they lost tons of good applicants because of the choice. 13) I have hear repeteadly from multiple search committees that rec letters tend to not be a real difference maker, and they are really good at introducing bias. They shouldn't be required at all (a ~5 minute conversation with the references of your short list candidates is really all you need). And if they are required, it definitely shouldn't be upfront! Most of them go unread... 14) the entitlement on this thread is shocking. SCs do not ""demand"" anything from anyone; it is a job posting. actually requiring 3 LORs up front might make the SC's job much easier by reducing the number of applicants to people who are willing to put in substantial up front effort 15) @14. Applicants caring about the time-sink that upfront letters mean to their letter-writers is the opposite of entitlement. SC's caring about their time, but not anyone else's time IS entitlement. 16) Deep breaths everybody. It's ok to just not apply for some jobs if you disagree with the posting. 17) I accidentally read the Virginia Tech update that said 311 people applied because I was only looking at the ""number applied"" column, which is 33, close to this job post. Any update on how many people applied to this position? I'm really hoping it's not 311., 18) I'm guessing it will be somewhere between 300-500... that's usually what happens with broad search like this one. 19) based on all the people who skipped this app because of the upfront letters I'm sure this search will fail! /s 20) Any word here? 21) With such a broad search and so many applicants, I expect it will be a while before anyone hears back from them. (22) SC seemed to indicate that they need letters up front because this process will be 'fast'—on the order of one or two weeks. If nobody's heard yet, I expect that requesting 900–1500 academic letters was a massive waste of everyone's time. (23) A few days ago I was asked by SC chair to have my missing LCs sent by end of November. (24) Well, that makes me think we won't hear anything until late November, early December. Also, that ref letters probably aren't being used to create an initial long list. (22 again) What a waste of everybody's time. (25) Any updates, SC? 26) Just got a phone invite for an on-campus interview in January x2 27) Congrats! Out of curiousity: Are you Eco or Evo? 26) Evo x2 27) No initial zoom interviews? 28) nope, straight to in person 29) I am really curious about the profile of people that got invites. The ad was really broad, I wonder if the interest was actually broad or if they had something mroe specific in mind (30) Rejection recieved, indicates negotiations have begun. 31) @30, rejection also recieved (12/22), however it suggested that interviews were set to begin in January. x6 (30 again) Actually it seems that was a rejection for the computational position... I wonder if I am a backup or something for this one... My mistake!  32) Over 250 applicants.  33) Offer recieved (34) just recently?

As for the faith aspect, faculty are expected to maintain a religious affiliation, but it does not have to be Baptist. Faculty candidates are expected to make a verbal expression of faith at some point during the interview process, and then demonstrate that (e.g., log worship attendance) if hired. 5) Is any sort of belief in magic acceptable? x3 6) Could anyone successfully apply for this? The dept is asking for the contact information for three references, to be uploaded in one file, but Interfolio won't allow that file to be uploaded. It insists on requesting a single confidential reference letter from a single referee and submitting that instead. Huh? x2 7) Just came here for this.

Would love some insight if anyone is familiar with the search! 3) The PhD program will be in Environmental Studies. The department is looking for strong scholars in any field of environmental or earth science as stated in the advertisement. 4) The ad asks for a ""research and teaching statement"".

The closing date says 23 Oct but in the text it says ""Deadline for full consideration of applications is 1 October 2022"" AP) I changed the ""Review Date"" to October 1 since that seems the most-relevant deadline. Also: two positions! 1) This might be a silly distinction, but do they mean plant biology and/or plant evolutionary biology, OR plant biology and/or general evolutionary biology? 2) Wording like this is intentionally vague, but usually means that they prefer hiring in plant + evolutionary bio, but will settle for either alone should the right candidate come along. 3) anyone have a view on whether this is search is likely to just hire 2 associate profs? This trend has been increasing and I don't see a top program like WashU not getting several associate prof ads. x2 4) @3 I went to WUSTL for undergrad and can confirm that several of their faculty--though not all, were hires of existing professors. No read on the new ad and how likely it is, however. 5) @3 There are 4 new TT faculty starting in this dept this fall (hires from the past 2 years) - 2 were postdocs prior to starting, 1 was a non-TT Asst Prof equivalent, and 1 was an Assoc Prof. In last year's hire, only postdocs and grad students were interviewed for an Asst Prof position. So, I wouldn't assume you don't have a chance in this hire if you are a postdoc  6) letters requested 10/18 x3 7) letters requested 10/20 x5 8) So, essentially they pulled letters for most applicants (7/9)? 9) i think probably more people have appliedbut haven't reported so here... 10) ~1/3 of applicants got requests for letters (in dept, not on search committee) (11) Wow, that is a huge amount! (12) @10, do you know how many applied? must have been a lot with such a broad call (12) Am I missing something? I applied to this position through Interfolio and the LOR were a required part of the application for me. 13) Ad reads ""Diversity and inclusion are core values at Washington University"".

I've never seen that ""grants submitted"" wording before - does this mean they want one to include grant submissions for which the outcome is yet to be decided, or is it asking for a list of past grant submissions, including unsuccessful ones? I could see it either way, e.g. for the second option they want to know about the effort put into grants that would be hidden if only successful grants were listed..., 3) Hello from Davidson, we are interested in any efforts to obtain funding. Unsuccessful, pending, or successful; all are indicative of effort and potential! 4) Thank you for your response and the very detailed job ad! 4.) Any chance of interest in invert organismal bio? I imagine not, but never hurts to ask :) 5) What a well-written job ad! A welcome change. 6) Davidson here. Thank you. :o)  And no, sorry, verts only (this time!) 7) I feel like postions like these are impossible to get. Publish lots. Show you get grants. And oh yeah, be an amazing tranformative teacher. But kuddos to the detailed add. This one should have an insane amount of apps. 8) I am concerned about it's Presbyterian association and associated Calvinist foundation. 9) I don't know much about Davidson, but many, many colleges/universities in the US were founded as religious institutions or with the goal of teaching clergy. It's a byproduct of the strong religious culture in early US history ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Many no longer have any affiliation, or if they do, it has little to no effect on students/classroom (especially older colleges). That said, there are still very religious colleges in the US. I'd encourage everyone considering a college with a religious founding to actually check out how religion impacts day-to-day life before judging a school for this. (x3)  10) Writing from Davidson here, re: our religious/Presbyterian association. I'd encourage anyone interested in the position to read the long job ad and note the things we do and don't emphasize in that document, which is designed to be a transparent and honest accounting of what life at Davidson would be like. It would not benefit candidates, our students, or our institution if we were hiding any reality about Davidson. 11) Former VAP here - I wouldn't be concerned about the Pres affiliation. Davidson has weakened its Pres affiliation somewhat in recent years if that matters, and it has essentially no bearing on the day-to-day of professors if they don't want it to. Religion didn't come up during my interview process or work there. It's a great place, apply! 12) The job ad asks for reference contact information to be included in the CV, but the online submission system also asks for it and says letters will automatically be requested. So are these letters due upfront and, if so, by what deadline? - Nevermind! I see in the short job ad that references will only be contacted if necessary, even though the system asks for the information. 13) This is slightly off topic for applications, but I chose not to apply because Davidson does not offer a very good package for dependents to attend the school. That is unusual for elite SLACs (which usually offer 90% tuition for dependents). I would not work for a school that I could not afford to send my own children to. 14) In case anyone is curious re: 13), Davidson offers 50% off tuition for 2 dependent children to attend any college in the country. 15) Anybody hear anything? 16) nothing as of 10/11 17) Hello from Davidson! Sorry for the delay. We have completed the first stage of screening based on the DEIJ statements and have begun the second stage. Everyone will be hearing from us soon with an update on your status, once we convince our online HR system to cooperate with us, that is 🙃 18) Thanks for the update! 19) Rejected based on diversity statement only.

Cost of living is quite reasonable. 2) I don't know about the salary range at Union College but I grew up in the tri-city area (Albany, Schenectady, Troy) and it is very affordable. 3) FYI - review date on Science jobs posting is listed at 9/16. Be careful with getting stuff in on time. 4) Are letters requested up front if an email is automatically sent to listed recommenders? 5) @4 I would assume so. 6) One of two tt openings in this Department - also hiring a Cell Biologist this cycle. 7) ""Advanced appointments for experienced candidates may be considered in exceptional cases."" 8) During application process: ""Applications are not considered complete until all letters are recieved."" 9) Be aware that the due date given to my letter-writers in the system-generated email was Sep 21. I'm informing them that they should be submitted by Sep 9, but there is potential for confusion here! 10) so to clarify, the letters should be in by sept 9? 11) It's unclear, but to be safe I'm asking my writers to submit by Sept 9. The system says the applications close September 16, so I would regard that as the last possible submission date. 12) I wish they would be clearer about this. It's unfair to our letter writers and adding unnecessary stress to the process x2 13) did anyone else notice the job ad asked for ""Up to three sample publications that best represent your work"" but the interface only allowed one file (after teaching, research, and diversity statements)? 14) @13 yes, same problem here...I merged my three example pubs into a single pdf document  15) Search Chair here. Sorry for the confusion about the dates. Letter writers are asked to upload their letters within 2 weeks of our Sept 9 deadline - so Sept 23. We will also accept late letters, but review of applications will begin Sept. 9. (The Sept 16 date listed on the System is a grace period for late applications, but review will begin Sept. 9.) 16) Thank you Search Chair for clarifying! I will note that my letter writers received a systems-generated email saying letters due October 7th. I will let them know that is an error. 9 again) Yes, it seems the automated system generates a deadline of 1 month after the application is submitted. Very confusing - thanks for clarifying things, SC! 17) these deadlines are a nightmare - I don't think this could be more confusing and stressful. Enough with the letters upfront y'all. Our poor letter writers are tired. 18) Anyone hear anything yet? (9/19) 19) no word x4 20) Search Chair here - Thank you for the interest (and feedback). I want to let applicants know that we are still reviewing candidates' materials, and won't have any news for another couple of weeks (9/22). 21) Thanks for the info, SC! x3 22) Darn! I did not see any of this yet and had no idea the date in the email to letter writers was wrong. This seems like a huge oversight and hopefully will be taken into account reviewing applications. 23) So what does this mean for letters that come in from this point until the 7th (or 8th as my email says)? Are they still reviewed and is the candidate penalized? 24) Any word? 25) Nothing so far x7 26) Search Chair here - We have not made invitations for ShortList interviews. Because our Department is carrying out 2 searches this term, our timing is slower than we'd like. Thank you for your patience.

Not sure if this is a new or failed search. 1) Search Committee Member here: The previous search failed. We re-vamped the position and are readvertising for an aquatic ecologist. We have removed the joint position as Assistant Director of PEREC. 2) requirement of expertise in algal, plankton, or macrophyte ecology. A little narrow of a focus? 3) Is it? Considering some of the job ads listed here these days, that seems about average. 4) I agree it makes it pretty narrow considering the rest of the call. Seems like it would exclude a whole lot of aquatic ecologists. Maybe search committee member could weigh in on how much that's being weighted? 5)Not a SC member, but this does seem about average in terms of focus. Freshwater algae, plankton or macrophytes each could be the focus of one TT position, so the fact that this one is open to any of those 3 specialists suggests it's not narrow. Sorry, fish biologist. 6) Search committee member here again: Yes, we are looking for a specific focus and knowledge base to fulfill some long-term contracts in the tidal freshwater system with regional funding sources. The current professor that covers those grants is set to retire soon, and we are looking for someone that would be able to complete the field and lab processing of those grants, in addition to their own research. 7) Note that the website now says that the review date is 10/1/2022 not 8/14/2022. This is confusing because the ad also says ""It is anticipated that zoom interviews for semifinalists will be conducted in early September, followed by on-campus visits by finalists. 8) Search committee member here: we have extended the deadline to 10/1/2022 and will therefore also adjust the semifinalist interviews to October 8) narrow enough the initial search failed and this one had to be extended, 9) Completed the application and submitted and it threw an error. It's listed on the status page under ""completed"", but no confirmation email. Going back to the page, I can view my completed application. I hope they get it.

The ecology ad is one of the first to be posted, hot off the presses. 5) Very exciting! Thanks!  6) Any insights into living in Portland with a family on 60-70k? (serious question, not snarky) Seem to be few houses under half a million. 6) former longtime Portland resident here - that salary is not commensurate to the cost of living there x2 7) This would be difficult if your partner didn't also work. 8) How do you know the salary?  Nothing on the job ad and when I searched for Assistant Prof salary there it looked like more? 9) @8, what was the salary you saw posted then? 10) https://american-school-search.com/faculty/lewis-clark-college 11) does anyone know the teaching load for this position? - didn't see it listed in the ad 12) I believe it's ""rotating slate of five lecture or lab courses per academic year"" but honestly don't know enough about PUIs to know exactly what that means. 13) @10, that site is incredibly inflated - maybe they adjust all salaries to 12-month, even though most are 9-month? Whatever the reason, they say the average Asst Prof salary at my school is $85k, but its actually ~$65k. The best source I know is the Chronicle of Higher Ed Faculty Salary Survey (just google it). 14) I always liked the AAUP survey tool (https://www.aaup.org/faculty-compensation-survey-results-tool). It has been right on the money (zing!) the times I needed that info. @11&12, from my PUI expeience, five courses/labs usually means a 3-2 load. Everything that takes 3 hours per week counts as 1 so it can be  a course+lab one semester, and the same + a single lecture the next. Keep in mind some institutions have their own way to describe load. During interviews ALWAYS ASK for how your ACTUAL schedule for the 1st Fall and Spring will be like. 15)  FYI: The salaries reported on the AAUP page are for Lewis & Clark State College in Lewiston, ID; so, those are salaries at a different university 16) The Chronicle faculty salary database lists Lewis & Clark average assistant prof salary at $68k. It does seem unusually low compared to a handful of other comparably ranked/sized/funded colleges I looked up, especially when you factor in the local cost of living. 17) yeah that salary is nuts for SW Portland 18)@6 Yes, I am from Portland and you would be on a tight budget making 60/70k if your partner did not also work, especially if paying for childcare- F/T preschool/daycare is around 1.3k/ mo, nannies charge around $25/hr. If you don't mind a longer commute, there are areas with lower cost housing. Also, teaching load at LC is as the person above stated (3/2 I believe) and 68k could be right- starting faculty salaries in Portland are often lower than NIH postdoc salary requirements- but it does seem low for a private school. It's a tough city for an academic, but also close to amazing, beautiful natural landscapes!  19) I currently live in Portland on a ~67K postdoc salary and can confirm that it's a tough salary; I rent a small home with my partner, and get by, but its tough to save / grow wealth (e.g., to buy a home); I love living in Portland enough to apply anyway, but would push hard for a more reasonable salary if given the chance. 20) application requires graduate transcripts - unclear if unofficial ones are acceptable at first. Also, no diversity statement requested, but cover letter should address DEI. Finally, the ad doesn't mention requiring evidence of teaching effectiveness, but the online system has a spot to upload this and says its required.  21) Per dept member - unofficial transcripts ok at application stage; official ones likely necessary before offer or with background check stage. Wide flexibility on additional teaching/research documents (plus checking which are req'd in interfolio set up). Search chair happy to answer questions. 22) Q for the search chair - is it possible to get a rough range for the salary of this position? +1 23) Any updates anyone? 24) Nothing here (10/11) x10. 25) I am really curious how many applications they had: over-under my money is > 300 and my point guess would be 366. 26) so if you're right @25, and only ~10 of us (~3% of applicants)  haven't heard anything, they could likely be already doing campus interviews and we would not know :(  27) I dunno, it seems unlikely that they could get through 360 applications quickly enough to be doing interviews already. But who knows on the applicant numbers! A couple years ago, I saw a little less than 250 applicants for a top R1 EBIO dept... seems like guesswork to me! Hang tight folks. 28.) Other positions at L&C (posted later in other depts) are already interviewing. Anyone have an update on where this search is at? 29) No updates here 10/26. But that’s discouraging to hear, @28. Where did you find out that other departments are already interviewing? x2 30) Also, @28, do you know which departments are already interviewing candidates? 28.) (again) -- Physics has zoom interviews this week. Spouse interviewed. Cluster hire across many depts of great interest to us :) 31) Departments typically run their own search schedules, and they can be affected by the size of the applicant pools. At a similar institution, we typically received 10x the number of applications than physics. 32:) from search chair- hoping to get zoom invite list finalized this week 33) Thank you for the update! x8 34) Recieved an email for a Zoom interview (11/11) x4 35) Aw shucks, but thanks for the updates. Congrats and good luck! X6 36) I'm assuming an offer has been made at this point but has anyone received a rejection letter/email? 37) Rejection email recieved after initial Zoom interview on 5 January 38) thanks for the update @37 and sorry to hear that :(  To clarify, your zoom interview was on Jan 5th or the rejection letter came that day? 39) @38 Rejection email after a Zoom interview held in mid-November 40) @39 thank you so much for the update 41) It sounds like the first choice candidate turned down their offer.
