(13) Recent hire in the department, and can attest that it's an extraordinarily supportive department with strong resources for any area, from field stations, to computational work. (14) @10 Just because the state of TX doesn't care about DEI, it doesn't mean the department doesn't.

If this is an ecoevo job, what biology job isn't? (2) Disagree with flag. ""Area of specialization is open."" Job could certainly be of interest to people doing heavily molecular-bio focussed evolution. 3) A molecular ecologsist or someone working on evo-devo may be interested in this job. x5 4) Seems broad enough of a job call to definitely be of use to evo-evo people, so let's keep it up - AFP 5) I applied for this job TWICE last year. They posted it, then reposted the ad after the dealine and asked everyone to reapply (I suspect because they forgot to ask for a research statement the first time), and then ended up canceling the search after the second deadline. It's the same ad for the same field. Just a note. 6) given the diversity of folks who follow this job board, I would like it to remain more on the inclusive side for job listings. I'm not a molecular anything btw, but I think we should keep it.

I think this is a great position for someone who is entirely focused on research and has no interest in teaching or outreach. You can build your own research program, but institutional support is more limited than what you would generally find at a traditional academic institution. There is a lot of pressure to bring in large federal grants, but if you feel confident in your ability to do so, it can be an excellent opportunity for the correct person. 4). I'm a scientist at Cary. Salary is competetive with top notch institutions. It is a hard money position with a community goal of recovering a portion of salary. Feel free to reach out to the search committee with any questions. Many many opportunities for outreach and teaching if interested. Communitity is caring and egaged. 5) I was also a field tech at Cary and I disagree with the statement that this is a position for someone who ""has no interest in outreach or teaching"". Not being a University does mean there is less teaching, but there are still plenty of opportunities to teach if the scientist is interested. Also, the amount of outreach Cary scientists do is often more than a tradition academic position due to the time release of not having consistent teaching requirements. 6) @4 I am curious about the faciltites at the institute, is there any opportunity to chat with someone before hand? I could not find information about labs and othr facilties on the webpage. 4) @6. The search committee is listed on the ad and enthusiastic to speak to folks. reach out to ask about facilities and what you would need to do great science! 5? 7) can anyone speak to the housing market there? It looks like there aren't many houses under $400k based on a quick search 8) Given what (7) had discussed, anyone know if a remote position would be considered? 9) Theres places well below that price 25 min away in Poughkeepsie. 10) @8 This is one of the premier field research oriented institutes in the States.

I know a person who applied but didn't get shortlisted for an interview due to the ""large number of applications"". Surprisingly, though, they still haven't been able to find someone to fill the role... Either they are looking for very top candidates, or the starting package is not attractive. Moreover, the working conditions are questionable (check it out here: https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/queen-mary-university-ucu-strikes-resignations-b1063246.html). 2) The appointment is permanent, not tenure track 3). Intra-department person here not involved in shortlisting. I heard through grapevine that shortlisting was difficult for this one. 5 were interviewed, top candidate was offered the job, but used it to negotiate better terms in their country. This took 1-2 months. 2nd-highest canidate was offered the job, turned it down because they are a postdoc and want to remain fully research-focused - this one does need a new Msc-level module. **I would strongly encourage past applicants to apply** - when there are are 50+ candidates, half of them are typically excellent... so the shortlisting process isn't random but its hard for it to be great - but one shouldn't interpret not being shortlisted as a rejection. 4) Recently my university hosted a researcher working at the School of Biological & Behavioural Sciences working in this particular field and in an informal conversation sHe expressed a very good impression of the departmentand and working conditions. We all know too well that universities positions not usually represent those of the departments and groups within. 5) Contrary to popular belief, the top candidate for the job did not negotiate a better position at their home university.

I'd apply if it got me a tour of the former rocket launch room. 5) The field of research is properly called ""Astrobiology"". ""Space Biology"" makes it seem like they're looking for a GIS tech. x2  6) Seriously, check out NASA's Exobiology program. There are a lot of opportunities for contemporary ecology, but it's not on a lot of folks' radar. 7) there are some pretty solid people in this dept, but also issues...as for the loose boundary between Exobiology (formerly Astrobiology) and Space Biology, NASA re-structured its funding divisions and moved human related research (Space Biology) into the general science funding pool, with the increased push for manned missions and the effects on humans (ionizing radiation is a biggy in this field) the center of Space Biology is shifting to microbial research and away from animal models...but that could change again.

Good Luck everyone! (Again) 2) UCSB had a similar position 3.5 years ago but it looks like no freshwater person in the department. Was that never filled or did that hire leave? x2 3) letters must be requested by the due date 4) I would've thought there'd be better salary support in such a high COL area 5) Based on other recent hires in UC system I know, I expect its in the mid to high end of that range for EEB hires. See the line about ""off-scale salaries"" 5) dept member here, @2 that search failed, an offer was made but the person went elsewhere, so we are re-running the search. @5, I can confirm that salaries for those recently hired are very much on the upper end of the quoted range.","","University of California-Santa Barbara","TRUE","CA",110705,"Santa Barbara","R1 Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity","Arts & sciences focus, high graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Comprehensive programs, no medical/veterinary school","Four-year, full-time, more selective, higher transfer-in","High undergraduate","Four-year, large, primarily residential","Not Classified","Far West AK CA HI NV OR WA","Public, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Public",1,"Suburb Midsize","Yes","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","No",0,7063,570,298,0,0,7931,241523,12911,527,882,41,52,179,26,272,26,414,156,6374,689,0,0,26314,28096,26179,25562.333333,23196,2983,22480,686,0,30,2774,209,4813,34,2351,102,NA,NA,19,45,NA,2063,0.260119,52,80,37,0.711538,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,1,18,17,9665,3957,1865,620,610,1230,28,25,25.96101,90961,33384,0.367014,3
