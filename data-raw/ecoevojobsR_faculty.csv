I think this is a great position for someone who is entirely focused on research and has no interest in teaching or outreach. You can build your own research program, but institutional support is more limited than what you would generally find at a traditional academic institution. There is a lot of pressure to bring in large federal grants, but if you feel confident in your ability to do so, it can be an excellent opportunity for the correct person. 4). I'm a scientist at Cary. Salary is competetive with top notch institutions. It is a hard money position with a community goal of recovering a portion of salary. Feel free to reach out to the search committee with any questions. Many many opportunities for outreach and teaching if interested. Communitity is caring and egaged. 5) I was also a field tech at Cary and I disagree with the statement that this is a position for someone who ""has no interest in outreach or teaching"". Not being a University does mean there is less teaching, but there are still plenty of opportunities to teach if the scientist is interested. Also, the amount of outreach Cary scientists do is often more than a tradition academic position due to the time release of not having consistent teaching requirements. 6) @4 I am curious about the faciltites at the institute, is there any opportunity to chat with someone before hand? I could not find information about labs and othr facilties on the webpage. 4) @6. The search committee is listed on the ad and enthusiastic to speak to folks. reach out to ask about facilities and what you would need to do great science! 5? 7) can anyone speak to the housing market there?

So, yes, there is love for plants :) anyone that may be a good fit should apply! 11) Also, notice that, while there is no mention of a diversity statement in the description of the job part of the post, a diversity statement is REQUIRED (this is mentioned at the very bottom of the post). 11) ""as long as their core question fits within the scope of the search"" -- which is... all of evolution? Also, who's the search chair? 12) ""All of evolution"" -- YES. This is for a broad search for an evolutionary biologist. The chair is Brent Lockwood (bllockwo@uvm.edu ). 13) These broad ""evolutionary biology"" searches aren't that uncommon... if you work on evoution you should apply. Or talk to the chair if in doubt.

I'd apply if it got me a tour of the former rocket launch room. 5) The field of research is properly called ""Astrobiology"". ""Space Biology"" makes it seem like they're looking for a GIS tech. x2  6) Seriously, check out NASA's Exobiology program. There are a lot of opportunities for contemporary ecology, but it's not on a lot of folks' radar. 7) there are some pretty solid people in this dept, but also issues...as for the loose boundary between Exobiology (formerly Astrobiology) and Space Biology, NASA re-structured its funding divisions and moved human related research (Space Biology) into the general science funding pool, with the increased push for manned missions and the effects on humans (ionizing radiation is a biggy in this field) the center of Space Biology is shifting to microbial research and away from animal models...but that could change again. There is also state funding, the Florida has state funding for space research. Just some comments from someone who was in the dept and is in this research field 7) the only way i'd work at a school in florida is if i could actually be in outer space most of the time x2  8) I have a colleague who could be a great fit for this, but the political backdrop is unsafe for one of his family members.  So he probably won't apply.  It's really unfortunate for a department that should recruit well otherwise. 9) I have a feeling at @7 is not a field biologist. Despite politics, there are a lot of reasons some biologists want to work in FL. x5 10) Yes. Gainesville is great (I don't live there, but would like to!) 11) 7 here, i am definitely a field biologist. i have no desire to live somewhere that is on the fast track to fascism. @9, i have a feeling you are a straight white christian man. 12) it's me, the real 7, looks like your counting is a bit off, and maybe we could not insult each other, going straight (pun intended) for identity instead of the argument, i mean, didn't we all take debate in 7th grade, attack the statement not the person, @ the false 7 and false 9, i mean with all the animosity online, i would like to think the highly educated could just not, academia is stressful enough in the job hunt, a safe forum for information sharing is a very low bar to clear","","University of Florida","FALSE","FL",134130,"Gainesville","R1 Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity","Balanced arts & sciences/professions, high graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Comprehensive programs, with medical/veterinary school","Four-year, full-time, more selective, higher transfer-in","Majority undergraduate","Four-year, large, primarily residential","Not Classified","Southeast AL AR FL GA KY LA MS NC SC TN VA WV","Public, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Public",1,"City Midsize","Yes","Yes","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",152,9923,3881,679,1180,0,15815,889677,52546,677,2358,56,40,434,149,530,149,1657,3404,4669,5254,0,160,52407,58857,53372,47038,34931,18441,31219,3018,257,437,12395,6046,6301,32,1555,194,NA,NA,27,52,NA,2123,0.13424,84,208,67,0.797619,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,1,26,21,10161,5133,3172,650,640,1290,29,27,27.763877,48193,15002,0.31129,3

There was also an earlier cluster higher this year to increase diversity in the department. OP) Great @2, thank you! 3) What kind of diversity? I think we know, but that is kind of vague really. 4) @3 I'm not associated with the department, I just looked at the prior ads e.g. the organismal bio job on line 1135 and the integrative bio one on last year's list.   In response (I am affiliated with the marine science program at St. Mary's College of Maryland) The marine science department is new, first recruited class started FA22, Fall 23 we are looking at more than doubling enrollment. We are increasing faculty & resources to keep up with increasing enrollment. Marine Science has only had one search. It was successful. More info about staffing is on our website. All the statements about previous cluster hires and other organismal and integrative bio hires is not from the marine science deparment. Those were in the biology department which does not oversee the marine science program.
