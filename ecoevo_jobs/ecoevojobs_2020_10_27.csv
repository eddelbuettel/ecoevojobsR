So Canadians are more likely to be hired, but in my experience it is not unheard of for a non-Canadian to get an offer. 4) My experience (as a Canadian who was not hired in Canada) is that the department can offer to a foreign candidate if they make the justification that the Canadian candidate(s) are ""not equally matched"".
