No one at Bennington has tenure proper, but we do have a system by which faculty are reviewed by their peers (internally and externally) on a slightly different timeline.

I am wondering if references be contacted for letters automatically after app submission, or after the first round of screening? 2) @5 Thank you and you're welcome. We will ask for letters from referees of only those that make it to the first round (Zoom, no more than 10) OR maybe just the final 3-4 who we plan to invite for campus visits (beautiful campus). 5) thanks @2, are there traditional US academic ranks in your system (Asst, Assoc, Prof) or is it simply ""full time/permanent"" or not? 6) Anyone have insight on whether the ""split position"" policy means they don't do real spousal hires or could it differ if spouse is in a different department? 2) @5, there is no traditional ranking, in fact, no offical or unoffical ranking or seniority at all. @6 Spousal hires have been done before, there are current openings in Chemistry, Sculpture, Photography, and soon to be advertised in Computer Science. It is possability (especially for spouses that can teach CS!), I would bring it up if you make it to the first round of interviews. 11) I noticed instead of a teaching statement, the job wants : c) descriptions of three potential course offerings -- I've never done something like this before, any guidance? For example, on how long and how much detail to go into for each course? 12) @11 The admin is fixing that clerical error. We DO want to hear about your teaching philosophy, which is paramount at a place like Bennington. Three class descriptions could easily fit on one page. I would check out course descriptions for current classes online. And I will just say that Bennington is a place that celebrates bold, unique, and niche curricula and pedagogy. 13) A heads up that the application form requires both a ""CV"" and a ""Curriculum Vitae""—I had to upload mine twice in order to submit my application 14) There are so many keywords that align with my background for the curriculum and teaching you're looking for and I love innovative pedagogy. But I am really nervous about the long-term financial viability of a small, environmentally-focused school like this after the closure of Marlboro College and Green Mountain College. I was also laid off from a position I had at Unity College during the pandemic, and so were many of the long-term faculty with active research and teaching labs. Can the SC speak to the long-term financial viability of the college? I apologize for asking that in such a blunt way. 15) This university already instituted a very public and widely-derided series of budgetary layoffs of profs with ""presumptive tenure"" in the mid 1990s. 2) @13 thanks, HR has been notified, but it appears the problem persists. To get the system to accept an application you may have to upload the CV 2x @14 Understandable concern about many SLACs. This may not help, but let me point out a few things. I would not call Bennington an environmentally-focuses school, not in the STEM sense of environemtnally-focused. Bennington is most well known for their visual & performing arts and literature programs. The incoming class of 2021 and 2022 are the 2 largest in the school's history, early signs indicate that 2023 might be even bigger. Also, no Bennington faculty (permanent nor visiting) were let go or fired during the pandemic. 16) This is a basic questions, but is there a salary range for this hire? Also, during these reviews are there opportunities for raises? I am asking becuase I know that promotion between assistant, assocaite, and full professor are the only opportunity that most professors have for any kind of financial advancement through their career. 2) @16 I compared my starting salary from when I started to the SLAC salaries reported in the negotiation tab for that same season, and mine was at the 60th percentile, so competitive. I don’t actually know for sure what you should expect, but my ballpark estimate would be high 60’s to mid 70’s. Also, according to Google, Bennington, VT cost of living is 83.9 (US average=100), driven mostly by low cost of housing. Oppertunity for rasies that go beyond the yearly CofL increases happen one-on-one with the Provost office. Following reviews before new contracts are signed are an ideal time to do this at the faculty memeber's inititive. 17) 16 here again, thank you very much for the detailed information and being so open, I greatly appreciate it!  18) according to the national çenter for educational statistics asst prof avg $73,480 in 2020-2021.  MIT says the required annual income in Bennington county for one adult w no kids is $34,860; one adult w 1 kid is $69,950; 2 adults no kids is $56,373; 2 adults 1 kid is $65,533, 2 adults w 2 kids is $77,957.  soooo, your salary Will be near the minimum livable wage for that region if you have any kids and you won't have tenure.  make informed decisions. 19) HA! 18 tries to troll against Bennington but makes the case against academia altogether, mean US salary won't work in rural VT, it's not going to work most other places.",7,FALSE,"Particular areas of focus include, but are not limited to, plant biology, natural history, ecosystem or landscape ecology, conservation or global change ecology, geographic information systems, biogeography, and/or evo-devo biology. 1) Is this position tenure track? The job ad doesn't say explicitly 2) Search chair here. @1 Bennington is a unique place. No one at Bennington has tenure proper, but we do have a system by which faculty are reviewed by their peers (internally and externally) on a slightly different timeline. I just went through the process myself for the first time, and I will repeat it again in 6 years. In practice, it is not too different. [extended discussion on lack of tenure removed - please continue at ""General Discussion"" -AP] 3) So the teaching load is 20 credits/yr or 4-5 courses year? because these seem quite different. 2) @3 Both. 1 lecture course = 4 credits. 1 lecture + lab = 6 credits. 4) which department is this position in, Biology? 2) @4 The position is in the ""Math and Science Discipline Group"". Within, are two full-time bio faculty, integrated organismal and cell/molecular, our long-time eco/evo faculty member retired two years ago. 5) There are some upfront and helpful SC members on here, thank you! I am wondering if references be contacted for letters automatically after app submission, or after the first round of screening? 2) @5 Thank you and you're welcome. We will ask for letters from referees of only those that make it to the first round (Zoom, no more than 10) OR maybe just the final 3-4 who we plan to invite for campus visits (beautiful campus). 5) thanks @2, are there traditional US academic ranks in your system (Asst, Assoc, Prof) or is it simply ""full time/permanent"" or not? 6) Anyone have insight on whether the ""split position"" policy means they don't do real spousal hires or could it differ if spouse is in a different department? 2) @5, there is no traditional ranking, in fact, no offical or unoffical ranking or seniority at all. @6 Spousal hires have been done before, there are current openings in Chemistry, Sculpture, Photography, and soon to be advertised in Computer Science. It is possability (especially for spouses that can teach CS!), I would bring it up if you make it to the first round of interviews. 11) I noticed instead of a teaching statement, the job wants : c) descriptions of three potential course offerings -- I've never done something like this before, any guidance? For example, on how long and how much detail to go into for each course? 12) @11 The admin is fixing that clerical error.

Last time around there were literally 3+ different advertisements posted with conflicting information.  Although the position says t here is an option for tenure, during the interview it was clear there was no intention of tenure being granted to anyone.  Second, it says collaborate on teaching, you will not be teaching anything.  This is again very poorly represented. There were other things that were clearly misrepresented in the advertisement last time around, but I have forgotten most as I moved on.  THE GOOD: The faculty were amazingly nice.  I got a distinct vibe they were frustrated with the way the advertisement was written, suggesting it was administratively altered from what they wanted.  But NOBODY said that, it is purely a vibe at my end.  Despite the Bad, I would have taken it as it seemed like a really good positions with good faculty, good pay and benefits, and in a reasonable cost of living area.  So, I felt the good outweighed the bad.  I will not be reapplying for it as I saw who they campus interviewed last time around, and they were clearly in a different fold than me. The QUESTIONABLE: the biggest red flag for me was that the spouse of the search chair last year is the asst director of the center.  Since she IS NOT on the search committee (unheard of in my book), she clearly must be a candidate.  I will guess she did not rank among the final group.  It is hard to believe that they were unable to fill this vacancy last year.  In fact, during my interview there was a off the breath, unintentional comment that they would do interviews and then start all over again.  This raises the suspicion on my part that the faculty want her, but admin want someone else.  Again, the questionable here is 100% speculation on my part.  I encourage you to apply because the advertisement looks way more defined this time around and as I said, I would have taken it.

I got a really good vibe from the faculty and staff I met with while there, and I think I would have really liked the position. I was disappointed to turn it down. The advertisement was a bit confusing, but during the campus visit I got some clarity. This is a primarily administrative position, running/promoting the center and facilitating the research of faculty, but not running your own research lab.  Teaching was not a primary part of the position, but it did seem some tropical field courses during the winter session may be possible. The previous director had two roles - a regular faculty member and the administrative director position.  Their plan was to split his position into two, so they would eventually hire another faculty member to teach his courses, and this director position would focus solely on the more administrative tasks.  This in combination with the search committee coming from a broad swath of the university (faculty, staff at the center, university advancement, facilities management, etc.) probably explains why the expectations weren't entirely clear in the advertisment.  For the tenure piece, they said this would have to go through a review first, ensuring you met their tenure requirements, and would generally happen about a year in and would give you retreat rights. I talked to adminstrators from a couple of other universities, and was told that this isn't uncommon, although it would have been disconcerting to leave a tenured position without a guarantee. I didn't get the sense that there was an inside candidate, although I wondered about that before I actually went to campus.

The hiring guidelines outlined by OPM and linked by @11 indicate that the hiring process is different for research positons. 12) another fed researcher here- for research potsitions there are often multiple certs... @11 is correct, but you can often pull a different cert if there's wonky vet stuff going on. If no additional certs and vet isn't a match for the job, it's often a close and re-ad, but I've also seen vets negotiate and then turn down, which also causes a failed search when the federal cert expires and you spent your time on a candidate that turns you down. 13) This search DID NOT FAIL last year. They hired someone: https://www1.usgs.gov/coopunits/staff/2289995 A new position opened because the previous co-op unit leader (who was the only one working on wildlife rather than fish) recently became the supervisor for the northeast and upper midwest cooperative reseach units. As a result, they now have 2 fish people and no wildlife people, and an opening.  14) There was a search this Spring that apparently failed (AFTER last year's hire that 13 is referring to above)",1

We argued against it but were told it was not up to us. @SC make sure you tell administration that you lost significant strong applicants because of their policy. Also this recent comment doens't seem to match what the previous SC comment about looking into upstream steps. There was clearly a dialogue there. Tell them next time they lost tons of good applicants because of the choice. 13) I have hear repeteadly from multiple search committees that rec letters tend to not be a real difference maker, and they are really good at introducing bias. They shouldn't be required at all (a ~5 minute conversation with the references of your short list candidates is really all you need). And if they are required, it definitely shouldn't be upfront! Most of them go unread... 14) the entitlement on this thread is shocking. SCs do not ""demand"" anything from anyone; it is a job posting. actually requiring 3 LORs up front might make the SC's job much easier by reducing the number of applicants to people who are willing to put in substantial up front effort 15) @14. Applicants caring about the time-sink that upfront letters mean to their letter-writers is the opposite of entitlement. SC's caring about their time, but not anyone else's time IS entitlement. 16) Deep breaths everybody. It's ok to just not apply for some jobs if you disagree with the posting. 17) I accidentally read the Virginia Tech update that said 311 people applied because I was only looking at the ""number applied"" column, which is 33, close to this job post.

Having the job boards tell them unequivocally that this is a very unpopular policy is valuable. x3 10) Grad student salary = ~$31K, MIT living wage = $34K, one of the best in the public sector. @7 Glad to hear those with tenured positions aren't applying - can you please wait a few years for the sake of the postdocs out there struggling to make ends meet while you play musical chairs with the very limited jobs bc of the pandemic? x6 11) @8, the committee member above seems to specify that this isn't an HR requirement but rather a choice of the committee. 12) SC - the requirement for letters up front was not the committee's choice. We argued against it but were told it was not up to us. @SC make sure you tell administration that you lost significant strong applicants because of their policy. Also this recent comment doens't seem to match what the previous SC comment about looking into upstream steps. There was clearly a dialogue there. Tell them next time they lost tons of good applicants because of the choice. 13) I have hear repeteadly from multiple search committees that rec letters tend to not be a real difference maker, and they are really good at introducing bias. They shouldn't be required at all (a ~5 minute conversation with the references of your short list candidates is really all you need). And if they are required, it definitely shouldn't be upfront! Most of them go unread... 14) the entitlement on this thread is shocking. SCs do not ""demand"" anything from anyone; it is a job posting. actually requiring 3 LORs up front might make the SC's job much easier by reducing the number of applicants to people who are willing to put in substantial up front effort 15) @14. Applicants caring about the time-sink that upfront letters mean to their letter-writers is the opposite of entitlement. SC's caring about their time, but not anyone else's time IS entitlement. 16) Deep breaths everybody. It's ok to just not apply for some jobs if you disagree with the posting. 17) I accidentally read the Virginia Tech update that said 311 people applied because I was only looking at the ""number applied"" column, which is 33, close to this job post. Any update on how many people applied to this position? I'm really hoping it's not 311., 18) I'm guessing it will be somewhere between 300-500... that's usually what happens with broad search like this one. 19) based on all the people who skipped this app because of the upfront letters I'm sure this search will fail! /s",34

I saw a VAP position on their website but did not even see the Eco position on their website.

The ecology ad is one of the first to be posted, hot off the presses. 5) Very exciting! Thanks!  6) Any insights into living in Portland with a family on 60-70k? (serious question, not snarky) Seem to be few houses under half a million. 6) former longtime Portland resident here - that salary is not commensurate to the cost of living there x2 7) This would be difficult if your partner didn't also work. 8) How do you know the salary?  Nothing on the job ad and when I searched for Assistant Prof salary there it looked like more? 9) @8, what was the salary you saw posted then? 10) https://american-school-search.com/faculty/lewis-clark-college 11) does anyone know the teaching load for this position? - didn't see it listed in the ad 12) I believe it's ""rotating slate of five lecture or lab courses per academic year"" but honestly don't know enough about PUIs to know exactly what that means. 13) @10, that site is incredibly inflated - maybe they adjust all salaries to 12-month, even though most are 9-month? Whatever the reason, they say the average Asst Prof salary at my school is $85k, but its actually ~$65k. The best source I know is the Chronicle of Higher Ed Faculty Salary Survey (just google it). 14) I always liked the AAUP survey tool (https://www.aaup.org/faculty-compensation-survey-results-tool). It has been right on the money (zing!) the times I needed that info. @11&12, from my PUI expeience, five courses/labs usually means a 3-2 load. Everything that takes 3 hours per week counts as 1 so it can be  a course+lab one semester, and the same + a single lecture the next. Keep in mind some institutions have their own way to describe load. During interviews ALWAYS ASK for how your ACTUAL schedule for the 1st Fall and Spring will be like. 15)  FYI: The salaries reported on the AAUP page are for Lewis & Clark State College in Lewiston, ID; so, those are salaries at a different university 16) The Chronicle faculty salary database lists Lewis & Clark average assistant prof salary at $68k. It does seem unusually low compared to a handful of other comparably ranked/sized/funded colleges I looked up, especially when you factor in the local cost of living. 17) yeah that salary is nuts for SW Portland 18)@6 Yes, I am from Portland and you would be on a tight budget making 60/70k if your partner did not also work, especially if paying for childcare- F/T preschool/daycare is around 1.3k/ mo, nannies charge around $25/hr. If you don't mind a longer commute, there are areas with lower cost housing. Also, teaching load at LC is as the person above stated (3/2 I believe) and 68k could be right- starting faculty salaries in Portland are often lower than NIH postdoc salary requirements- but it does seem low for a private school. It's a tough city for an academic, but also close to amazing, beautiful natural landscapes!  19) I currently live in Portland on a ~67K postdoc salary and can confirm that it's a tough salary; I rent a small home with my partner, and get by, but its tough to save / grow wealth (e.g., to buy a home); I love living in Portland enough to apply anyway, but would push hard for a more reasonable salary if given the chance. 20) application requires graduate transcripts - unclear if unofficial ones are acceptable at first. Also, no diversity statement requested, but cover letter should address DEI. Finally, the ad doesn't mention requiring evidence of teaching effectiveness, but the online system has a spot to upload this and says its required.  21) Per dept member - unofficial transcripts ok at application stage; official ones likely necessary before offer or with background check stage. Wide flexibility on additional teaching/research documents (plus checking which are req'd in interfolio set up). Search chair happy to answer questions. 22) Q for the search chair - is it possible to get a rough range for the salary of this position? +1",22,FALSE,"""Three letters of recommendation to be uploaded separately by recommenders."" - boo x5 1) wow, this seems like a really early announcement for a job that would begin in Fall 2023. 2) FYI the college is also searching for positions in math, biochemistry, physics, art and theater. 3) #2 do you know if the Chem position is TT? I saw a VAP position on their website but did not even see the Eco position on their website. TIA! 4) this is #2 again - yes, those are all TT positions but the listings are just getting going... expect to see more in the summer.  The ecology ad is one of the first to be posted, hot off the presses. 5) Very exciting! Thanks!  6) Any insights into living in Portland with a family on 60-70k? (serious question, not snarky) Seem to be few houses under half a million. 6) former longtime Portland resident here - that salary is not commensurate to the cost of living there x2 7) This would be difficult if your partner didn't also work. 8) How do you know the salary?  Nothing on the job ad and when I searched for Assistant Prof salary there it looked like more? 9) @8, what was the salary you saw posted then? 10) https://american-school-search.com/faculty/lewis-clark-college 11) does anyone know the teaching load for this position? - didn't see it listed in the ad 12) I believe it's ""rotating slate of five lecture or lab courses per academic year"" but honestly don't know enough about PUIs to know exactly what that means. 13) @10, that site is incredibly inflated - maybe they adjust all salaries to 12-month, even though most are 9-month? Whatever the reason, they say the average Asst Prof salary at my school is $85k, but its actually ~$65k. The best source I know is the Chronicle of Higher Ed Faculty Salary Survey (just google it). 14) I always liked the AAUP survey tool (https://www.aaup.org/faculty-compensation-survey-results-tool). It has been right on the money (zing!) the times I needed that info. @11&12, from my PUI expeience, five courses/labs usually means a 3-2 load. Everything that takes 3 hours per week counts as 1 so it can be  a course+lab one semester, and the same + a single lecture the next.
