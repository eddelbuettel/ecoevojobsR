Do Hamilton faculty take graduate students? 3) SC member here, all life sciences faculty on Miami's regional campuses have lab and office space on the Oxford campus and have the opportunity to mentor graduate students 4) Any info on what the teaching load for this position would be? 5) The base load is 24 contact hours a year. Pretenure faculty reveive a release to 21. A typical semester is 2 lectures and 2 labs. Faculty teach their own labs, but there is support staff for lab prep. 6) that seems like a high teaching load in biology, even for an R2 7) And especially if they really want an active research program. 7) Research expectations are scaled to account for the fact that regional faculty have a higher teaching load than main campus collegues. The expectations are more in line with a regional comprehensive than a R2. 8) @5 would this usually be 2 sections of the same lab/ lecture or 4 individual courses? 9) 5 again, there are a lot of possibilities and we try to be flexible. It could be 1 lecture (3 hours) and 2 lab sections (2 hours each) associated with that lecture and then another lecure course with no lab (3 hours).

Plus, the same people complaining about internal hires would complain if they were the internal candidate and the institution hired ""some unknown"" from outside. At most institutions, especially in tight budget years, if a professor leaves or retires, the department is given a NTT line for a year while they try to get approval for a full search. So, of course there is a NTT faculty member with the same expertise as the job ad. Unless it is a new program, who else do you think is currently teaching the classes / doing the job that the department is looking to fill on a long-term basis? On average, the person who takes a VAP/adjunct position in spring/summer (in searches that are not typically very competitive) is not going to magically be the most qualified candidate for an international search the following September (when most TT jobs advertise) - they often haven't even started the 1yr job yet when the TT ad gets posted, so the idea that the TT ads are often written around the expertise of an internal candidate who has barely even started working in the department is laughable. There are of course exceptions, but don't assume that its a sham search just because they have a NTT faculty member currently in that role. 2) If you'd like ot work there apply...3) Looking at the NTT faculty lab webpage, he is already advertising for PhD students in the fall 2023 and spring 2024 semesters, not something a NTT lecturer can do. 4) Definitely feels like an internal hire given @3's comment and the specificity of the posting x5. 5) preordained Internal hires only happen if a spouse is involved. Being an internal candidate who is qualified for the position is both an advantage and disadvantage because they know you.  You can show off your sparkles, but you can't hide your warts in that situation.  So, an interviewee will be fresh, warts hidden.  Therefore, you have to really work to make your positives outshine your warts when an internal candidate.  ",5

I see that position had interview requests go out late Feb. 9) 8 here - I would assume those are for the other position - the close date was a couple weeks earlier than this one, so it'll probably be at least another week or 2 before interview requests go out for this position. 10) Numerous hits on my website from Drexel on March 7-8.

A colleague got an email stipulating this a week after the ad closed. 22) @21 what does 'candidate only ready selected mean' I havn't heard that term before! xD @21-22, check job ID # on the ""we selected a candidate"" letter, I received a letter like this few days ago and it was from SOEST (not School of life Sciences/CNS) and job ID was for different UH job posting to in oceanography. I doubt this position has moved to letter requests at this stage.@21-22 Candidate only ready selected? what does mean, do you move or not? or what is that? LOL mine says under review. 23) I am #22, sorry to confuse, I was asking what 21 meant by 'candidate ready selected' I don't know what this term means either - how do you check if your application is under review? @23) no worries! it is just that i dont know what candidate ready selected would mean. I cant figure out if that means you are selected to continue or excluded. haha anyway, you can log into your candidate profile (it is the same link, look up right) and check the application status. In my experience it only updates for those that move forward if any action is required from the candidate. But... also I am waiting to hear if I go on campus interview from a couple places and just says under review. 24) the ""candidate only ready selected"" from @21 is pretty clearly a typo, should be ""already selected"", and this is certainly not in relation to this job post but another UH job where a hire was made. 25) @24 - thanks for the clarification! 26) letters requested 1/20 27) were letter requests sent to applicant or directly to referees? 28) to referees 29) Received request for zoom interview 2/14 x2 30) request for in person interview 03/10/23",12

Don't let the website, designed by an IT contractor, dictate your application. (12) Canadian immigration law and work permit statutes require #6 in job ads. No way around it.

Many of our faculty are not Canadian. 13) @11, great, thanks for the help.. rolling my eyes. 14) Citizenship matters less than your connections to certain senior UBC profs 15) @ 14), do you mean senior UT profs, or am I missing something here? (16) UBC and UofT hire a lot of one another's graduates, and @14 is referencing that fact somewhat cynically. 17) this thread seems pretty toxic :/ (18) ah, i see, thank you @16. (19) its not toxc to point out that UBC practically runs the show up in Canada, which is what @14 is saying. it is what it is, and people should apply with their eyes open (20) Can anyone from the department speak to the culture in EEB? Some very divisive opinions out there... (21) @9 @10 the ad says _organism_ or group of organisms, so I think even if you focus on a single organism if there's a strong natural history component of your work, it seems in bounds (22) @14, UBC is a big EEB department in Canada and a lot of great people come out of there, so there probably is a network effect, but UBC trainees are not particularly over-represented among assistant profs at U of T , recent hires come from a bunch of different programs 23) Ok this is kinda dumb, but I'm not really clear on what ""a deep natural history knowldege of an organism"" (singular) really entails? Knowledge of its evolutionary history? Life-history? Ecological role? All of the above? 24) Not speaking from any particular knowledge about this search or call but it probably references having a system rather than being a methods-type biologist who is system-agnostic? 25) @23 sorry to be blunt, but if you're asking this you're probably not a good fit fot the position 26) Autecology i.e. physiological ecology-type studies where you will focus on a single species or small group of related organisms is usually what ""organismal ecologist"" tends to mean. Not populations, communities, or ecosystems. 27) Wondering if the identity of the search committee chair gives a clue about whom they are looking for ""Organismal Ecology and/or Evolution""? 28) @25 notice you didn't give your expert definition. Do you feel better about yourself after writing that helpful comment? Thanks to 24 & 26 for their thoughts! 29) Based on the language in the ad, I would interpret this as a really broad search, along the lines of @24. I think if they specifically wanted someone working at a particular scale (e.g. physiology) they'd mention that in the ad to save time sifting through apps! 30) Disagree with the previous comment. I think they would have just said ""ecology"" or ""evolution"" if they were open to community & ecosystem ecologists. 31) Whether its written as a broad search or not, you should still apply. Apply. To. Everything. 32) The EEB department is great, not biased at all, but in all honesty, everyone is super friendly and open to collab. 33) Do not Apply. To. Everything. Apply where you think you will be a good fit, and where you think you will be happy, apply to everything leads to a lot of noise and wasted time for applicants, committees, reference letter writers, it's not worth it, the pay is bad, the academic system is toxic, what's the whole point. 34) my interpret 35) lol at ""the EEB dept is great..."" a recent review found a huge amount of race & gender based harassment, competitiveness, toxicity etc. within the dept (to be fair probably not at all unique to this dept or school, and at least there are ongoing targeted efforts to improve things) - a former PhD student 36) Just a heads up that the automated letter requests trickled out slowly to my referees over the 24+ hours following my application submission...so leave plenty of time before the deadline... 37) yup that was super weird re the emails to the referees. Why?! (38) @35 I am a former graduate student in the dept as well. I think a lot of this had to do with a couple of ""keystone individuals"" who are now gone/retired. Recent hires indicate that the dept is moving in an extremely positive direction. 39) change has already ""Start""'-ed there, huh @38? 40) Does anyone have insight into how these different campuses work? I expected the campuses to operate as their own institutions, but I see that the department lists faculty across all campuses. (38 again) Graduate program is united across campus, undergraduate programs separate (though all degrees say 'U Toronto'). Less connection between campuses than you'd think. I only went once to UTM and never to UTSC. 41) @40 faculty members are sometimes the committees of grads from other campuses, but all undergrad teaching is on their home campus. Really nice to have a broader group of faculty for student committees, but making connections takes a bit of effort because there's generally not a lot of movement between campuses. 42) Do complete ref letters need to be submitted by Jan 4th? Or just the other application materials + requests for letters? I'm applying pretty late (Dec 28th), don't want to waste my time if the letters need to be sent within a week. 43) My read on it was that the letters need to be in by the 4th. x4 44) Bummer. I really wish academic jobs would not require letters of rec up front. Wrangling my letter writers to get anything submitted for a dealine is hell. 44) This deadline was particularly difficult - right after the holidays when folks may still be away or are inundated with work because they just got back... I got my letters in but it took a lot of emailing my writers while they were on break 45) @44 I wonder if that explains the relatively low ""number applied"" 46) the language concerning preferential hiring of Canadian applicants doesn't help. 47) sure @46, but other Canadian positions (for which the same applies) have had similar or greater numbers applied even with more narrow job focuses 48) yes @47 but the combination of timing, letters up front, and Canadian preference adds up. CDN positions seem to score about half the applications of US equivalents, compare UBC's search with equivalent searches in the US. But agreed this is surprisingly low...good for those of us who did apply I suppose. (49) The majority of recent hires at UBC are Ivy-league educated Americans. (at ECR stage) 50) yes @49 but there are people who will see that language and decide it is not worth applying, regardless of whether it is. Combined with letters up front over the holiday break and I can see a lot of people deciding this isn't worth bothering their referees over. 51) Anyone hear anything about this job yet? 52) Nope (26 Jan) x2 53) Postdoc at UofT here. The seminar schedule for the semester just got sent out with time held on Mondays and Thursdays for the job talks, but no specific dates or names yet. 54) Thank you @53! 55) Thank you 53 - can you tell us what dates those job talks are set for? That might give hints as to the timeframe they'll use to notify the short-list - assuming they haven't already. 56) The slot on the seminar list is set in between a Feb 10 seminar and March 1 seminar, so potentially in that period? Though specific dates not posted yet, says dates TBD. 57) Thanks! 58) Still nothing here as of 2-3.

Integrating into your teaching statement is not equivalent. 8) From the direct link: ""Content addressing the candidate’s approach and commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion should be directly incorporated into the research and teaching statements."" They're not asking for it just in the Teaching as you suggest, they want it incorporated in both the teaching and research statement. Research and teaching are the biggest component of a faculty position, telling them how you are incorporating DEI into those activities is a better way to evaluate candidates than the cookie cutter statement telling them that DEI is important, that you read a book about it, that you went to a workshop, etc. An overall better approach to gauge actual commitment x2.  9) Arguably integrating DEI into diversity and teaching statement is better and more revealing than a separate statement, as it can show that your commitment to DEI pervades all aspects of your scholarly activities, rather than being a separate statement you to just check a box. 10) anyone heard anything? 11) Nothing 15/1 x3 12) I received an email that they've already selected a candidate for this position (15/1) 13) @12 Was this a form email or a response to a query?

This is not approved yet, but it seems likely that it will happen before the new year. Make sure that you ask about this if you get to the finalist stage as the details are important and will indeed likely mean then end of tenure as it currently exists for faculty in Florida. 5) thanks for this info @4, do you have a source where we could read about this? I honestly would like some review of tenured faculty given that many of them are the reason academia sucks in many aspects, but if this post tenure review process involves some political bull that makes it easy for schools to pay people less, then I wouldn't touch that with a ten foot pole. Ok, after googling it this is really concerning in my opinion. I also didn't know about this: ""The survey, required in a bill approved last year, posed questions asking if students felt their professors used their platforms to inject their viewpoint and asked all about their political beliefs."" https://www.tampabay.com/news/education/2022/04/19/desantis-signs-bill-limiting-tenure-at-florida-public-universities/ 6) FYI, this program has hemorrhaged minority assistant professors in recent years,  has one of the lowest stipends for students in any R1 grad program. But I am sure they will ask about your efforts to promote DEI. 7) Faculty here are actively working to improve stipends, unlike many R1 grad programs in the state. 8) I was in the department as a grad student about a decade ago. Ive since been a grad student or postdoc at several ""elite"" instutions. The education, training, and support I got here was the best I've had in my career. That being said, the stipend was a serious serious challenge. 9) I'd say losing tenure and being in an environment where climate change, evolution, gender and other topics  are considered political beliefs rather than concepts with scientific basis, would be a really bad mix. Imagine doing a 5 year post doc over and over again until you retire. Nope. Let Florida wipe out its SUS. 9) @6 I find it very telling that a department at a hispanic-serving institution has maybe one Latinx faculty in the roster only. 10) I did my PhD there, can confirm only 1 non-white profs, very disappointed as a BIPOC member. 11) I wanted to comment on the survey mentioned above. The survey was responded by only 2% of faculty and students, not representative. Besides, they found NOTHING to support the stupid idea that professors are injecting their political viewpoints on students. Yet, FL is a scary state, I lived in South Florida a few years and, as a WOC, never found community. My neighbours never came to say hello despite we all had kids around the same age. 12) what do half of these comments have to do with this position? stop rambling about how your neighbors in Florida didn't say ""hi"" to you or whatever. this is irrelevant. keep your political and cultural opinions to yourself. if you aren't interested in the job amd have nothing relevant to say then stay on Twitter. k (x1) 13) As someone who was considering applying for this position, I found these comments very relevant 14) @12 Wow! you are just unbelievable. Those were some genuine concerns from people who had first-hand experiences of the workplace and the living conditions and very relevant for potential applicants! 15) @12 Agreed with @14 - even as someone from Florida (who moved before grad school), I found this very relevant and helpful and I otherwise would not have thought about checking in to certain things. I will also not be applying to this position, as much as I'd love to end up back there. 16) When I was at UCF there was a large international graduate student contingent in the department and it was a welcoming place. I also had friendly neighbores... That's my anecdote so take it for what it's worth. 15) Well, I am devastated. I could not submit my application, which I have been working on for weeks, due to a an error with the submission site. Now the due date has passed, and the site has closed. Anyone else? Website says ""Thank you for your interest in career opportunities with the University of Central Florida.  We received your application.

This is not approved yet, but it seems likely that it will happen before the new year. Make sure that you ask about this if you get to the finalist stage as the details are important and will indeed likely mean then end of tenure as it currently exists for faculty in Florida. 5) thanks for this info @4, do you have a source where we could read about this? I honestly would like some review of tenured faculty given that many of them are the reason academia sucks in many aspects, but if this post tenure review process involves some political bull that makes it easy for schools to pay people less, then I wouldn't touch that with a ten foot pole. Ok, after googling it this is really concerning in my opinion. I also didn't know about this: ""The survey, required in a bill approved last year, posed questions asking if students felt their professors used their platforms to inject their viewpoint and asked all about their political beliefs."" https://www.tampabay.com/news/education/2022/04/19/desantis-signs-bill-limiting-tenure-at-florida-public-universities/ 6) FYI, this program has hemorrhaged minority assistant professors in recent years,  has one of the lowest stipends for students in any R1 grad program. But I am sure they will ask about your efforts to promote DEI. 7) Faculty here are actively working to improve stipends, unlike many R1 grad programs in the state. 8) I was in the department as a grad student about a decade ago.

Search chair asked about marital status and made awkward comments about it. A total of 3 people came to my research talk, including not a single person from the department other than the chair. Either (a) really dysfunctional department, or (b) they already had an internal candidate in mind and everyone in the department thought the interview was a sham. It's one thing to have an internal candidate (as has been discussed here, this cuts both ways), but the whole experience was incredibly unprofessional on their part, and I have not considered any jobs there in the years since. Hopefully this is a different situation...*to be fair, the chair at the time is no longer at the institution 3) It would seem to be odd for them to be advertising three jobs simultaneously and have internal candidates for all three at an institution that doesn't offer PhDs, my guess is this is an institutional approach?  4) You're probably right @3, though they do sort of offer PhDs through UMaine, and most internal candidates are not PhD students but VAPs or something similar. Three at the same time seems odd though, maybe its a budget thing or maybe they just want to speed up the timeline. I can't imagine an institutional policy to have all jobs start reviewing candidates immediately though.  5) It is a very unusual college in how it is structured and how many jobs are teaching only. 6) @2/4, could you elaborate on the PhD program through UMaine? One reason I would NOT apply is that I would like to mentor doctoral students. Is it possible to do so through this program, in your experience? Thanks! 3) FWIW, I contacted an admin and they stated that they won't begin review until 11/9/22, so it sounds like there are cutoffs for full consideration (I imagine it would be hard to be fully considered after that date) that are not being advertised 7) I can't find any current info on their PhD partnership with UMaine-perhaps it had been through a grant. But, it was something similar to this https://www.une.edu/research/cen/students/graduate 8) This is a masters only graudate program with the College of Arts and Sciences.

Long post - this was a response from HR regarding how the digital interview works:  You’ll receive your questions in two parts (video and written). Part 1 of 2 will be the video portion. You’ll see the question listed in the “QUESTIONS IN THIS PART” just above the get started boxes (see attached in my sample screen shot the question is listed as “1. This is a test video question…”). By viewing this question in advance you can prepare your response before selecting “get started.” Once you select “get started” you will have an opportunity to test your mic and video then record a practice round; you can do this as many times as you’d like but it will not be recorded. Following your practice you’ll select the “START REAL INTERVIEW” option. This button will begin your recorded interview response (you will have 3 attempts, but only the most recent attempt will be kept for submission). After completing your video response you will receive a similar screen with Part 2 of 2, in which the questions for your written responses will be displayed. Again, you can take your time drafting your responses to the listed questions (in a separate Word document, if you choose). Once you select the “GET STARTED” button a 10 minute timer will begin to record your written response. At any time in the process you can close the window to stop the interview then use your link to return where you left off; however, progress will not be saved (ie if you started writing a response and close the window it will not be saved (but remember you can draft your response before beginning the written portion). The interview link expires 10 days from when it was sent (yesterday). !!! 31) So the first video question is ""How do you see your research and teaching goals complementing the work of others at VIMS and advancing our strategic plan?"". But has anyone gone further than that? How long can the answer be? And what are the following questions?  32) Tempted to ask them for written Qs to limit redundancy in our responses. Also for the 3/4 written questions can we just copy+paste from word? 33) Just bumping this in case anyone has made any progress. Frustrating to no know if there is a time limit for the video response, and what the following written questions are...  34) Haven't started yet but found out the written responses can be prepped in Word and then pasted - so the 10min typing limit seems irrelevant. 35) The practice video response is 1 minute. Can anyone confirm that's the time limit for the actual video response (this seems very short). 36) its 4min I believe 37) Any updates (1/2)? 38) Or, any idea if they are going to have another review for the next 1/5/23 deadline? 39) Got an email saying a reference had been recieved for this position, so I assume they've asked for letters (1/4) x4 40) @39 were you part of the first round or did you submit for the 1/5/23 deadline? 41) Not @39 but I also received letter request and had submitted for 1st round x4 42) On-campus invite recieved (1/13) x2  43) I had no word till today saying they're reviewing digital interview responses... A bit confused by what this means when others have on-campus interviews 44) @43 its a cluster hire so maybe they're continuously reviewing the pool of applicants as they find people to fit certain niches? They had a 2nd review date of 1/5 so they may be reviewing previous applicants along with any new applicants? Just guessing though.  43) Yeah they confirmed different position hires are happening at different times, hence only a few invites sent out so far   44) Ecological modeler here, got on-campus invite 2/7/23 45) @44 thanks for adding your field, very helpful! and if others want to do the same as invites roll out that would be great 46) Any news from the first round? 47) 8 March, nothing... 48) They currrently have scheduled 12 on-campus interviews, not sure if they'll be adding any more at this time. 49) @48 Do you know if that is 12 total or 12 in addition to the first round? 50) @48 I was one of the 12 and a first rounder, but not sure about the others 51) re-re-re-rejected 3/22.

It's been a couple of weeks since my zoom interview with them 3/12 24) I had mine on 2/28, and asked them about next steps + timeline - they said it might take them until end of March to be ready announce on-campus invites. 25) thanks @24!

That is why they called it out.  OK has a growing grape industry, established pecan industry, and several kinds of greenhouse farm production.  So, this is a position established to target USDA NIFA funding streams.  I know people are trying to be funny, but I figured I might provide a bit of info being that I am very familiar but external to the department! :)",

Also note: no separate DEI statement, but include DEI efforts in research & teaching statements as appropriate (not popular). -AP]  2) Thanks AP. (3) Dear SC: Asking for a DEI statement merged with research statement is extremely unconventional! 4) SC member here: if you have research-related DEI activities, include them in your research statement; if you have teaching/mentoring-related DEI activities, include them in your teaching statement. We don't expect everyone to have both categories. 5) @ SC - what about service related DEI activities? 6) heads up: although the linked job ad says that application materials should be combined into one PDF, the website to apply has spots to upload documents individually and seems to indicate that the PDF will be concatenated by the system (though there was no way to double check that happened) 7) @5, I'm not SC, but I'm mentioning my service-related DEI activities in my cover letter. 8) 'Extremely unconventional' is very diplomatic: this merged DEI/Research and DEI/Teaching format is crazy. 9) Yea, SC members, if you are still hear to read this: I think my DEi efforts are seriously reduced and diluted by forcing this format change that nobody else seems to have. A lot of my DEI activities have been service related, because *spoiler alert* I don't have big grants through which to have made research DEI impacts, nor as a postdoc do I control who I teach or even mentor. So all the extra time I spend on DEI in service areas is either hamfisted into teaching statement (poorly) or cut. I can't be the only one. 4) SC member again: sorry for the format of the DEI statement, this was completely out of our control. I'll be sure to forward your feedback to the relevant authorities for future searches. Put your service-related DEI in either the cover letter or the teaching statement - we'll find it in any case.

I'll reach out to whoever gets the offer with a range of comps so you have good info for negotiation. 10) thanks a lot for your reply @4 ! it was preventing me from applying (maybe not only me)... 11) Another search comm member here. That salary range definitely isn't right. Salaries here are comparable to other R1s. 12) just wanna say I really appreciate the SC members coming here to clarify, help, and forward feedback. We appreciate you  4) SC again: @12 thanks! We're working through 159 applications now, stay tuned. 13) 159 is almost exactly 10x the applied number here, more evidence this trend is alive and well 14) Any updates? 15) 159 seems very low for such a broad job description.. any ideas why this job didn't get more applications? 16) Guessing ""quantitative"" caused many people to self-select out of this application. Given that truly broad apps like Minnesota and U. Arizona probably got 400-500 applications, 150 (~30-40%) seems reasonable as a fraction of those applicants who identify as quantitative! Interested in other theories or inside knowledge about this! 17) Maybe fewer people want to move to Lansing, MI?

You don't control how many applicants apply but you control how many make it to the intermediate list… 30) My guess from serving on previous search committees is that they did not have a set number of candidates they wanted to keep on the medium/short list, but simply retained as many applicants as they were still interested in @30) 21 and 159 are boh odd numbers, neither is a multiple of 2... 31) loo(x4)ool 32) any update? 2/10 33) Given what just happened at MSU, I would expect some delays.. :( 34) So sad and horrifying 35) SC members, if you're reading this, we're thinking of you! Hope you can take care of yourselves and your communities x8 36) On campus interview invitation 2/24 x2  SC) @34-35, thanks for the kind thoughts. @36, looking forward to meeting you next month. Keeping with our odd theme, we invited 5 for interviews, but would be delighted to have all of you as colleagues. 37) @SC Thank you for being so informative throughout this process, we really appreciate it. Makes it extra sad to miss out on this one!   38) As one of the 16, I am curious how ""quantitative"" this hire ends up being, but indeed thanks for the frequent updates! ",17,FALSE,"""statistical methods development, novel applications of cutting edge quantitative methods, or other advanced modeling of natural systems""  [Lengthy discussion of the definition of ""quantitative ecology"" moved to General Discussion. Also note: no separate DEI statement, but include DEI efforts in research & teaching statements as appropriate (not popular). -AP]  2) Thanks AP. (3) Dear SC: Asking for a DEI statement merged with research statement is extremely unconventional! 4) SC member here: if you have research-related DEI activities, include them in your research statement; if you have teaching/mentoring-related DEI activities, include them in your teaching statement. We don't expect everyone to have both categories. 5) @ SC - what about service related DEI activities? 6) heads up: although the linked job ad says that application materials should be combined into one PDF, the website to apply has spots to upload documents individually and seems to indicate that the PDF will be concatenated by the system (though there was no way to double check that happened) 7) @5, I'm not SC, but I'm mentioning my service-related DEI activities in my cover letter. 8) 'Extremely unconventional' is very diplomatic: this merged DEI/Research and DEI/Teaching format is crazy. 9) Yea, SC members, if you are still hear to read this: I think my DEi efforts are seriously reduced and diluted by forcing this format change that nobody else seems to have. A lot of my DEI activities have been service related, because *spoiler alert* I don't have big grants through which to have made research DEI impacts, nor as a postdoc do I control who I teach or even mentor. So all the extra time I spend on DEI in service areas is either hamfisted into teaching statement (poorly) or cut. I can't be the only one. 4) SC member again: sorry for the format of the DEI statement, this was completely out of our control. I'll be sure to forward your feedback to the relevant authorities for future searches. Put your service-related DEI in either the cover letter or the teaching statement - we'll find it in any case. Sorry y'all! 10) isn't salary 60000.00-85000.00 Salary Commensurate with Experience a bit low? found this info here: https://careers.msu.edu/en-us/job/512493/assistant-professortenure-system 4) @10 SC member here: I have no idea where that salary range came from (HR?) but it doesn't reflect the salaries of recently hired asst profs, which have all exceeded that upper limit. I'll reach out to whoever gets the offer with a range of comps so you have good info for negotiation. 10) thanks a lot for your reply @4 ! it was preventing me from applying (maybe not only me)... 11) Another search comm member here. That salary range definitely isn't right. Salaries here are comparable to other R1s. 12) just wanna say I really appreciate the SC members coming here to clarify, help, and forward feedback. We appreciate you  4) SC again: @12 thanks! We're working through 159 applications now, stay tuned. 13) 159 is almost exactly 10x the applied number here, more evidence this trend is alive and well 14) Any updates? 15) 159 seems very low for such a broad job description.. any ideas why this job didn't get more applications? 16) Guessing ""quantitative"" caused many people to self-select out of this application. Given that truly broad apps like Minnesota and U. Arizona probably got 400-500 applications, 150 (~30-40%) seems reasonable as a fraction of those applicants who identify as quantitative! Interested in other theories or inside knowledge about this! 17) Maybe fewer people want to move to Lansing, MI? Or it's not considered a ""trade-up"" school for Profs already in TT position? 18) @17 not historically the case for MSU, it's a pretty desirable program. 19) any update? 20) nothing here 12/10 21) SC again: don't expect any news until January.

The job ad doesn't say explicitly 2) Search chair here. @1 Bennington is a unique place. No one at Bennington has tenure proper, but we do have a system by which faculty are reviewed by their peers (internally and externally) on a slightly different timeline. I just went through the process myself for the first time, and I will repeat it again in 6 years. In practice, it is not too different. [extended discussion on lack of tenure removed - please continue at ""General Discussion"" -AP] 3) So the teaching load is 20 credits/yr or 4-5 courses year? because these seem quite different. 2) @3 Both. 1 lecture course = 4 credits. 1 lecture + lab = 6 credits. 4) which department is this position in, Biology? 2) @4 The position is in the ""Math and Science Discipline Group"". Within, are two full-time bio faculty, integrated organismal and cell/molecular, our long-time eco/evo faculty member retired two years ago. 5) There are some upfront and helpful SC members on here, thank you! I am wondering if references be contacted for letters automatically after app submission, or after the first round of screening? 2) @5 Thank you and you're welcome. We will ask for letters from referees of only those that make it to the first round (Zoom, no more than 10) OR maybe just the final 3-4 who we plan to invite for campus visits (beautiful campus). 5) thanks @2, are there traditional US academic ranks in your system (Asst, Assoc, Prof) or is it simply ""full time/permanent"" or not? 6) Anyone have insight on whether the ""split position"" policy means they don't do real spousal hires or could it differ if spouse is in a different department? 2) @5, there is no traditional ranking, in fact, no offical or unoffical ranking or seniority at all. @6 Spousal hires have been done before, there are current openings in Chemistry, Sculpture, Photography, and soon to be advertised in Computer Science. It is possability (especially for spouses that can teach CS!), I would bring it up if you make it to the first round of interviews. 11) I noticed instead of a teaching statement, the job wants : c) descriptions of three potential course offerings -- I've never done something like this before, any guidance? For example, on how long and how much detail to go into for each course? 12) @11 The admin is fixing that clerical error. We DO want to hear about your teaching philosophy, which is paramount at a place like Bennington. Three class descriptions could easily fit on one page. I would check out course descriptions for current classes online. And I will just say that Bennington is a place that celebrates bold, unique, and niche curricula and pedagogy. 13) A heads up that the application form requires both a ""CV"" and a ""Curriculum Vitae""—I had to upload mine twice in order to submit my application 14) There are so many keywords that align with my background for the curriculum and teaching you're looking for and I love innovative pedagogy. But I am really nervous about the long-term financial viability of a small, environmentally-focused school like this after the closure of Marlboro College and Green Mountain College. I was also laid off from a position I had at Unity College during the pandemic, and so were many of the long-term faculty with active research and teaching labs. Can the SC speak to the long-term financial viability of the college? I apologize for asking that in such a blunt way. 15) This university already instituted a very public and widely-derided series of budgetary layoffs of profs with ""presumptive tenure"" in the mid 1990s. 2) @13 thanks, HR has been notified, but it appears the problem persists. To get the system to accept an application you may have to upload the CV 2x @14 Understandable concern about many SLACs. This may not help, but let me point out a few things. I would not call Bennington an environmentally-focuses school, not in the STEM sense of environemtnally-focused. Bennington is most well known for their visual & performing arts and literature programs. The incoming class of 2021 and 2022 are the 2 largest in the school's history, early signs indicate that 2023 might be even bigger. Also, no Bennington faculty (permanent nor visiting) were let go or fired during the pandemic. 16) This is a basic questions, but is there a salary range for this hire? Also, during these reviews are there opportunities for raises? I am asking becuase I know that promotion between assistant, assocaite, and full professor are the only opportunity that most professors have for any kind of financial advancement through their career. 2) @16 I compared my starting salary from when I started to the SLAC salaries reported in the negotiation tab for that same season, and mine was at the 60th percentile, so competitive. I don’t actually know for sure what you should expect, but my ballpark estimate would be high 60’s to mid 70’s. Also, according to Google, Bennington, VT cost of living is 83.9 (US average=100), driven mostly by low cost of housing. Oppertunity for rasies that go beyond the yearly CofL increases happen one-on-one with the Provost office. Following reviews before new contracts are signed are an ideal time to do this at the faculty memeber's inititive. 17) 16 here again, thank you very much for the detailed information and being so open, I greatly appreciate it!  18) according to the national çenter for educational statistics asst prof avg $73,480 in 2020-2021.  MIT says the required annual income in Bennington county for one adult w no kids is $34,860; one adult w 1 kid is $69,950; 2 adults no kids is $56,373; 2 adults 1 kid is $65,533, 2 adults w 2 kids is $77,957.  soooo, your salary Will be near the minimum livable wage for that region if you have any kids and you won't have tenure.  make informed decisions. 19) HA! 18 tries to troll against Bennington but makes the case against academia altogether, mean US salary won't work in rural VT, it's not going to work most other places. 19) to 18.  you are either clueless or a liar. 2) I know many ask about this metric, so...1:8 We got 8 applications for every 1 selfreporting on ecoevojobs. 20) Interesting!

I know there were a lot of applicants and the chances that they would have been interested in me are small anyways, but it would have been nice to hear back before needing to accept something else! 30) my best guess is that they will start to make moves this week. I can imagine they have a lot going on so maybe a shorter week gave them the time necessary 31) It's been 2 months since the application deadline and still no one has heard anything? 32) nope 12/9 x5 33) references requested 12/12 x5 34) references and Zoom interview requested 12/12 x3 35) Strange, so some just got references requested while others got references requested and the Zoom interview invite? 35) wondering if SC can clarify-were the reference only emails in error? Or do you have two batches of candidates selected? 36) anyone have insight into what is going on here? Did the letter only people have their references contacted? 37) Today 38) anymore updates? have any of the references only people heard more about zoom interviews? when did the people with zoom requests schedule their interviews for (before or after holidays) ? 39) really? no one can answer @38?? 40) Had gotten an interview request on 12/12 but interview not scheduled yet. SC would need to clarify points 35-38, but yes, seems like there are two batch of candidates if some people didn't get an interview request. 41) I recieved a request for my reference writers' contact on 12/12 via an email that also stated I would be invited for a Zoom interview in Jan. Have not recieved any follow-up on that for scheduling. I will follow-up with them on Jan 3rd just to make sure I didn't miss or misinterpret anything if I haven't heard from anyone by then.

""I have a strong commitment to learn French"". Somehow I doubt that. Non-French speakers should apply with extreme caution 4) Probably the same way they judge other components of the application. Definitely apply with caution, but if you've been studying French for years and just need a bit of immersion to truly unlock fluency consider, ""I have a strong commitment to learn French and this is how I plan to do that."" similar to how you write your research and mentorship plans. 5) A friend who got interviewed for this search last year had no French, but could demonstrate that they had learned another foreign language during their postdoc abroad - I guess this was sufficient to demonstrate commitment/ability to learning a language required for a job. 6) Can someone on the search committee be transparent about the odds for a non-french speaker? These apps take time and I do not want to waste mine applying for a position that would never really consider me. I certainly would be committed to learn French, though. 7) you would almost certainly be expected to teach in French for undergraduate courses. I would not bother applying if you have never studied French at even a basic level...unless you have something more convincing to say than I'm excited about this job. 8) I was in this department as an anglophone/allophone postdoc. A serious commitment to learning French is obviously important, but there are professors on the faculty whose background is very anglophone. As someone mentioned above, anglophones have made it to the interview stage in recent searches and given their talks in English. But besides teaching, you may not feel fully a part of the departmental community until you have good conversational French. 9) @5 your friend wasn't hired so... that commitment clearly wasn't enough to make it through 5) @9 They dropped out of the search to take a different opportunity. In any case, final offers can be made or not made to a given applicant for any number of reasons...but they fact that they interviewed someone with no French seems like relevant information for others here asking if French fluency is an absolute pre-requisite...  10) Previous search for this position did not fail b/c someone dropped out though 11) TT faculty member here, not on SC. I was recently hired despite speaking zero french (A1 level, no prior 2nd language experience), and the other 3 shortlisted candidates were in the same boat. Also, the dept.'s most recent TT hire (cross-appointed with other dept.) also speaks zero french. So the dept. is entirely open to hiring non-french speakers and has a recent precedent of doing so. All interview steps are conducted in english and the uni offers an intensive french-learning program for as long as is necessary. What is required is merely a statement in the application package about having a desire to learn french. This is generally interpreted as sincere because, tbh, why would a non-french speaker apply to a francophone uni if they had no desire to learn french? So the bar for convincing the SC of this is pretty low (though it is helped by things like a french-speaking family member, prior 2nd language experience, etc). Also, all faculty, pretty well all students, and most staff speak english, so it's always an option in unofficial settings despite french being the default language. And fwiw, everyone (faculty, students, staff, deans, etc) has been very patient and supportive with me as I learn the language. However, tbh, it can be stressful (esp. teaching en français) and, as @8 says, can result in relatively slow dept. assimilation. But I suspect this will vary depending on personality type.  11) Treat it as a non-wnglish speaker applying for a job in Anglophone North America? 12) @11, maybe easier than that because the large majority of people at U of Montreal speak english too. 11) Absolutely, and people very understanding of non-native speakers, which is often not the case in Anglophone places 12) Search committee had to be reorganized due to too many confilcts of interest, so could be some time on this one  13) 2 failed searches in a row for this position is not a good look 13) did the first search also fail because of conflicts of interest? 14) I don't think this search is failed per se, they plan to reorganize and hire still for the fall. First search failed because someone accepted the position and then backed out at a very late stage. 15) name and shame plz 16) any updates? 17) I haven't heard anything yet (as of 1/23) x3 18) Still nothing as of 1/30 x4 17) Does anyone have any idea on timelines here? The wait is certainly frustrating 18) Invited for interview on 2/3 (x2)",6,FALSE,"1) This is a repost from a failed search last year 2) Must already be fluent in French 3) or have a strong commitment to learn French 4) Which the committee judges how? ""I have a strong commitment to learn French"". Somehow I doubt that. Non-French speakers should apply with extreme caution 4) Probably the same way they judge other components of the application. Definitely apply with caution, but if you've been studying French for years and just need a bit of immersion to truly unlock fluency consider, ""I have a strong commitment to learn French and this is how I plan to do that."" similar to how you write your research and mentorship plans. 5) A friend who got interviewed for this search last year had no French, but could demonstrate that they had learned another foreign language during their postdoc abroad - I guess this was sufficient to demonstrate commitment/ability to learning a language required for a job. 6) Can someone on the search committee be transparent about the odds for a non-french speaker? These apps take time and I do not want to waste mine applying for a position that would never really consider me. I certainly would be committed to learn French, though. 7) you would almost certainly be expected to teach in French for undergraduate courses. I would not bother applying if you have never studied French at even a basic level...unless you have something more convincing to say than I'm excited about this job. 8) I was in this department as an anglophone/allophone postdoc. A serious commitment to learning French is obviously important, but there are professors on the faculty whose background is very anglophone. As someone mentioned above, anglophones have made it to the interview stage in recent searches and given their talks in English. But besides teaching, you may not feel fully a part of the departmental community until you have good conversational French. 9) @5 your friend wasn't hired so... that commitment clearly wasn't enough to make it through 5) @9 They dropped out of the search to take a different opportunity.

Last time around there were literally 3+ different advertisements posted with conflicting information.  Although the position says t here is an option for tenure, during the interview it was clear there was no intention of tenure being granted to anyone.  Second, it says collaborate on teaching, you will not be teaching anything.  This is again very poorly represented. There were other things that were clearly misrepresented in the advertisement last time around, but I have forgotten most as I moved on.  THE GOOD: The faculty were amazingly nice.  I got a distinct vibe they were frustrated with the way the advertisement was written, suggesting it was administratively altered from what they wanted.  But NOBODY said that, it is purely a vibe at my end.  Despite the Bad, I would have taken it as it seemed like a really good positions with good faculty, good pay and benefits, and in a reasonable cost of living area.  So, I felt the good outweighed the bad.  I will not be reapplying for it as I saw who they campus interviewed last time around, and they were clearly in a different fold than me. The QUESTIONABLE: the biggest red flag for me was that the spouse of the search chair last year is the asst director of the center.  Since she IS NOT on the search committee (unheard of in my book), she clearly must be a candidate.  I will guess she did not rank among the final group.  It is hard to believe that they were unable to fill this vacancy last year.  In fact, during my interview there was a off the breath, unintentional comment that they would do interviews and then start all over again.  This raises the suspicion on my part that the faculty want her, but admin want someone else.  Again, the questionable here is 100% speculation on my part.  I encourage you to apply because the advertisement looks way more defined this time around and as I said, I would have taken it.  But, I have a rule that if you invite me for a telephone interview and don't bring me in you lost your chance, especially when my CV is better than anyone on staff. ;).  I bet they know who wrote this if they are checking the page! Oh well! :). 2). was offered this position last time it was advertised, but I had to turn it down because I was not able to negotiate a spousal hire (Spousal hires are out of the norm for their campus, although some other UW campuses do it). I got a really good vibe from the faculty and staff I met with while there, and I think I would have really liked the position. I was disappointed to turn it down. The advertisement was a bit confusing, but during the campus visit I got some clarity. This is a primarily administrative position, running/promoting the center and facilitating the research of faculty, but not running your own research lab.  Teaching was not a primary part of the position, but it did seem some tropical field courses during the winter session may be possible. The previous director had two roles - a regular faculty member and the administrative director position.  Their plan was to split his position into two, so they would eventually hire another faculty member to teach his courses, and this director position would focus solely on the more administrative tasks.  This in combination with the search committee coming from a broad swath of the university (faculty, staff at the center, university advancement, facilities management, etc.) probably explains why the expectations weren't entirely clear in the advertisment.  For the tenure piece, they said this would have to go through a review first, ensuring you met their tenure requirements, and would generally happen about a year in and would give you retreat rights. I talked to adminstrators from a couple of other universities, and was told that this isn't uncommon, although it would have been disconcerting to leave a tenured position without a guarantee. I didn't get the sense that there was an inside candidate, although I wondered about that before I actually went to campus. Long story short - if you think you would enjoy a more administrative role and don't need a spousal hire, I wouldn't hesitate to apply for this position. 3). the search committee chair is married to I another prof in same program.  I know other faculty in other departments.  they can do spousal hires.  typical of admin - faculty conflict.  I saw the names brought in.  you would have been a great hire.  as I and you said, it seems like a good job.  btw, I was told point blank it wasn't getting tenure.  any normal vacancy will set applicant standards such that tenure is granted automatically upon a 1 yr preliminary period.  the more I think about what I was told compared to what you  are relaying, the more I'm glad I didn't end up there.  they are clearly rushing into an advertisement without sufficient forethought.  it reminds me of a trainwreck I was once associated with.  lots of people making plans with no real experience or competency to do so.  don't mistake this for bitterness.

This in combination with the search committee coming from a broad swath of the university (faculty, staff at the center, university advancement, facilities management, etc.) probably explains why the expectations weren't entirely clear in the advertisment.  For the tenure piece, they said this would have to go through a review first, ensuring you met their tenure requirements, and would generally happen about a year in and would give you retreat rights. I talked to adminstrators from a couple of other universities, and was told that this isn't uncommon, although it would have been disconcerting to leave a tenured position without a guarantee. I didn't get the sense that there was an inside candidate, although I wondered about that before I actually went to campus. Long story short - if you think you would enjoy a more administrative role and don't need a spousal hire, I wouldn't hesitate to apply for this position. 3). the search committee chair is married to I another prof in same program.  I know other faculty in other departments.  they can do spousal hires.  typical of admin - faculty conflict.  I saw the names brought in.  you would have been a great hire.  as I and you said, it seems like a good job.  btw, I was told point blank it wasn't getting tenure.  any normal vacancy will set applicant standards such that tenure is granted automatically upon a 1 yr preliminary period.  the more I think about what I was told compared to what you  are relaying, the more I'm glad I didn't end up there.  they are clearly rushing into an advertisement without sufficient forethought.  it reminds me of a trainwreck I was once associated with.  lots of people making plans with no real experience or competency to do so.  don't mistake this for bitterness.  I would have been taking a sig pay cut!!! 😜",

(17) @15 Webinar recording was intended but unfortunately there was a technical issue and it was not done. (18) @9 @16 Letters are requested automatically when you submit your application. The job ad doesn't say there's a deadline for the LOR but they expect to receive them by the deadline. (19) @14 It would depend on your other obligations of course, but the EEB dept is currently extremely strong in Ecology and lacking in Evolution. (20) Ivies gonna Ivy, still asking for letters at application. Automatically makes it not worth applying if you're not from an Ivy yourself. (21) I interviewed in this department a few years ago, with a non-Ivy background. (22) @18 @9 @16 Can anybody confirm that letters are requested automatically at the time of submission? I submitted but my recommenders haven't received anything yet, so maybe they're planning to only request from the long list despite what they said at the webinar, or there's a step that needs to be done manually?  23) I don't see any indication on the application form that references will be contacted immediately, and I thought the webinar got canceled? I am very confused about this LOR situation. 24) I submitted my application on 10/25, and my references were contacted for letters on 10/29; since review isn't supposed to start til 11/1, maybe they are just requesting them all manually, or there's a delay in the automatic request system. 25) They ARE requesting LOR from the onset.  There's a few days of delay between submitting and the requests, so they might have some initial screening, but they aren't waiting for a short list (I though this was very misleading in their advert) x2 26) Welp so much for that application. I totally thought letters were NOT due upfront. x5 27) After submitting my application (right at the review deadline), it said that I had until 11/4 to update materials, and my letter writers were contacted. I don't know if they were given a date to get letters in by. For whatever this info is worth to folks. 28) I know a PI who is writing letters for to different people for this job, and they were contacted on different days about them (11/5 and 11/6). Seems like it is being done manually. Oof. 29) It is definitely being done manually by someone in the department, I've seen the email they have to send out. Double oof. 30) I don't understand about the LOR supposedly being sent out by hand. My LOR were something sent out automatically when I started my application? 31) One of my letter writers told me that the LOR requests didn't include a deadline. 32) @31 hope that's true because one of mine didn't get sent until this week 33) @32 - Whoa! It's quite the system they have going on there.  34) If LORs are requested by a search member, they are more likely to be curated than if an admin is sending them all by hand.  Anybody have info on that?  My letters were requested ~2 days after submission, before the deadline.  35) @34, the email address the request came from belongs to an EEB administrator (one of my refs forwarded me the request so I could see it); if letter requests are curated, then it's probably only insofar as they check that you followed the application instructions before requesting references 36) In the webinar they said that a shortlist would be contacted mid-late Dec. They probably received 300+ applications (900 letters manually requested) so it makes sense if it would take a while. 37) Postdoc in the department here: I've heard that ~270 applications were received. (38) Interesting, it's the same as U Virginia. (39) Any news? 3-dec-22 (40) Nothing here x4 (41) Department postdoc here. Seems like they are starting campus interviewing candidates this week. (42) @41 Are they sending invites this week or are they starting the campus interviews already? Are they going to invite (or have invited) candidates for Zoom interviews first? (43) 41 again. I was not involved in the process. I just heard that a candidate will giving his/her job talk today in person. Sorry that I do not know more inforamtion. Hopefully this helps. (44) Thank you @43! So, they're already inviting people for on campus interview. That's fast! (45) Seems odd that nobody from this board was contacted for an interview...46) Didn't they say interveiws were in January at the webinar? Perhaps the candidate who spoke today is being considered for a different position? 47) 41 again. @46, that's possible, I am not sure. Apologies for the confusion if this is the case. (48) @41 no problem! Any info is useful! Thanks for sharing. At the webinar they said the short list would be out mid-/late-December and the interviews would be Jan/Feb. I believe they didn't mention Zoom interviews but I might be wrong.

(59) I'm in the backup list and never hear from the chair of the SC since early February. x2",22,FALSE,"multiple positions, broad search, does not say tenure track. 1) I think these are tenure-track positions. 2) Pretty sure these are tenure-track, especially since they are considering hiring at Assistant, Associate, and full Professor levels. 3) surely tenure track; dept. doesn't really do non-tenure track. apply if interested, this is a game-changing department full of all-star researchers and good people. 4) Happy grad students paid above a living wage! 5) is it even worth applying considering i just started my first postdoc, have 13 total pubs and not Nature/Science? 6) Things to ask yourself, ""Am I an all-star?"" Is the marginal effort worth a shot if I'm not? 7) Almost certain there is a Smash Mouth tshirt in my parents attic. I can put it up on ebay if any of the eventual campus invites are interested. x2 8) @6: no! 9) anyone know if the letter writers will b contacted right away? 10) Seems strange that there is no teaching/mentoring or diversity statement in the app, does anyone know if this is normal for Princeton? 11) Princeton EEB was a 100% white Dept. (until very recently) and it's a little behind on DEI 12) I thought I saw they will have a webinar about how to apply somewhere on twitter? I can't find the link 13) from evoldir ""For anyone interested, the search committee will host a Q&A webinar on Sept 21st, 12-1pm Eastern Time [link deleted -AP]"" 14) Should we not bother applying if our work is more ecology than evolutionary biology? 15) Anyone know if the webinar was recorded/will be posted online somewhere? 16) @9 anyone know about when letter writers are contacted for this position? (17) @15 Webinar recording was intended but unfortunately there was a technical issue and it was not done. (18) @9 @16 Letters are requested automatically when you submit your application. The job ad doesn't say there's a deadline for the LOR but they expect to receive them by the deadline. (19) @14 It would depend on your other obligations of course, but the EEB dept is currently extremely strong in Ecology and lacking in Evolution. (20) Ivies gonna Ivy, still asking for letters at application. Automatically makes it not worth applying if you're not from an Ivy yourself. (21) I interviewed in this department a few years ago, with a non-Ivy background. (22) @18 @9 @16 Can anybody confirm that letters are requested automatically at the time of submission? I submitted but my recommenders haven't received anything yet, so maybe they're planning to only request from the long list despite what they said at the webinar, or there's a step that needs to be done manually?  23) I don't see any indication on the application form that references will be contacted immediately, and I thought the webinar got canceled? I am very confused about this LOR situation. 24) I submitted my application on 10/25, and my references were contacted for letters on 10/29; since review isn't supposed to start til 11/1, maybe they are just requesting them all manually, or there's a delay in the automatic request system. 25) They ARE requesting LOR from the onset.  There's a few days of delay between submitting and the requests, so they might have some initial screening, but they aren't waiting for a short list (I though this was very misleading in their advert) x2 26) Welp so much for that application. I totally thought letters were NOT due upfront. x5 27) After submitting my application (right at the review deadline), it said that I had until 11/4 to update materials, and my letter writers were contacted. I don't know if they were given a date to get letters in by. For whatever this info is worth to folks. 28) I know a PI who is writing letters for to different people for this job, and they were contacted on different days about them (11/5 and 11/6). Seems like it is being done manually. Oof. 29) It is definitely being done manually by someone in the department, I've seen the email they have to send out. Double oof. 30) I don't understand about the LOR supposedly being sent out by hand. My LOR were something sent out automatically when I started my application? 31) One of my letter writers told me that the LOR requests didn't include a deadline. 32) @31 hope that's true because one of mine didn't get sent until this week 33) @32 - Whoa! It's quite the system they have going on there.  34) If LORs are requested by a search member, they are more likely to be curated than if an admin is sending them all by hand.  Anybody have info on that?  My letters were requested ~2 days after submission, before the deadline.  35) @34, the email address the request came from belongs to an EEB administrator (one of my refs forwarded me the request so I could see it); if letter requests are curated, then it's probably only insofar as they check that you followed the application instructions before requesting references 36) In the webinar they said that a shortlist would be contacted mid-late Dec. They probably received 300+ applications (900 letters manually requested) so it makes sense if it would take a while. 37) Postdoc in the department here: I've heard that ~270 applications were received. (38) Interesting, it's the same as U Virginia. (39) Any news? 3-dec-22 (40) Nothing here x4 (41) Department postdoc here. Seems like they are starting campus interviewing candidates this week. (42) @41 Are they sending invites this week or are they starting the campus interviews already? Are they going to invite (or have invited) candidates for Zoom interviews first? (43) 41 again. I was not involved in the process. I just heard that a candidate will giving his/her job talk today in person. Sorry that I do not know more inforamtion. Hopefully this helps. (44) Thank you @43! So, they're already inviting people for on campus interview. That's fast! (45) Seems odd that nobody from this board was contacted for an interview...46) Didn't they say interveiws were in January at the webinar? Perhaps the candidate who spoke today is being considered for a different position? 47) 41 again. @46, that's possible, I am not sure. Apologies for the confusion if this is the case. (48) @41 no problem! Any info is useful! Thanks for sharing. At the webinar they said the short list would be out mid-/late-December and the interviews would be Jan/Feb. I believe they didn't mention Zoom interviews but I might be wrong. (49) Any invitation yet for in person interviews? any update on whether the event discussed in the previous comment was the official inverview? (50) Have heard early career interviews (ie asst level hires) have not yet started (51) On-campus interview invitation (am postdoc) X3 (52) Rejection received by email 01/24 x3 (53) I never received a rejection or an invite. x3 (02/1)  54) Just received an email that sounds like I'm on some kind of backup list for interviews, but it's difficult to tell if that is real. x4 (02/01) 55) the email I got was along the lines of 'we're not inviting you so it's over, but it may not be over.' Appreciate getting an update. 56) I also got a non-rejection letter.  Sounds like we are the backup list if things fall though (which is very common with open rank searches). 57) Got a back-up list email, too - is there any timeline for back-up interviews?

I'm pro-veterans preference for federal jobs, but this can sometimes be a consequence.8) I believe the one this spring was for the unit leader, while this is for an assistant unit leader. 9) This is the same position from the spring. 6) #5 - do you know for a fact that this was the specific issue or are your making an assumption, here? There are other classes of non-federal employees who also have preference. Veteran's preference will only get you 'referred to the hiring manager' for these higher-level research positions - it's up to the hiring manager and coopeartors to choose who they bring in for interviews. Veterans cannot ""bump"" another qualified individual from the pool of resumes that are sent to a hiring manager (though this is different for postions at lower GS levels). These searches fail for a number of different reasons including disagreement among coopeators working with the specific Unit. Curious why you specifically thought 'Veteran applicants' was the reason this search failed. 10) Institution should be USGS, not University of Maine x2 11) @9 your understanding of how the veteran's preference works is incorrect, see the corresponding section here (https://jabberwocky.weecology.org/2021/06/14/usajobs-guide/) for a more accurate description. In brief, if a singular veteran is deemed qualified, no one can be considered unless the individual in question turns the job down. When faced with a situation where only a single candidate can be considered, SC have been failing the search prior to interviews. 12) @6, here - I'm a diabled veteran (and tenured faculty) who has applied to half a dozen of these positions, interviewed for 2, and not selected for any of them. I do know those who were selected for those postions did not have veterans preference. As I mentioned earlier in this post, veterans are alowed to apply to these federal-only positions because I have veterans preference - it does not guarantee an interview or a job offer (this would be different for a non-science or research job at lower GS levels). The hiring guidelines outlined by OPM and linked by @11 indicate that the hiring process is different for research positons. 12) another fed researcher here- for research potsitions there are often multiple certs... @11 is correct, but you can often pull a different cert if there's wonky vet stuff going on. If no additional certs and vet isn't a match for the job, it's often a close and re-ad, but I've also seen vets negotiate and then turn down, which also causes a failed search when the federal cert expires and you spent your time on a candidate that turns you down. 13) This search DID NOT FAIL last year. They hired someone: https://www1.usgs.gov/coopunits/staff/2289995 A new position opened because the previous co-op unit leader (who was the only one working on wildlife rather than fish) recently became the supervisor for the northeast and upper midwest cooperative reseach units. As a result, they now have 2 fish people and no wildlife people, and an opening.  14) There was a search this Spring that apparently failed (AFTER last year's hire that 13 is referring to above) 15) @6 veterans preference no longer counts above the GS12 level. The jobs you interviewed for but did not get above a non-veteran must have been GS13 or above. 16) Any updates? 17) Just got this for both GS12 and GS13: ""There are other applicants who, by law, must be considered before your application, such as displaced federal employees, certain Veterans, and others entitled to special consideration.

The people I know who went to PC as students were not religious. I am an ex-Catholic and I'm applying to another position at PC, so I'm interested to see what others have to say.  3) Spring search was for VAP/adjunct positions so this is a new search! Many students and faculty at PC are not religious and/or a religion other than Catholic. 4) While the current employees are probably very accepting and not that religious, if asked during an interview about your religious affiliation or interest, my experience around other religiously affiliated universities tells me that there is, in fact, a right answer. 5) Faculty member in the department chiming in to say that few of us are religious, and that's perfectly fine as long as you can tolerate writing a response to the mission statement that addresses faith and reason as compatible, and as long as you're okay with super big crucifixes, it's a thing. Besides that stuff, we're always trying to be a more inclusive and welcoming department to students from all walks of life. 6) thanks @5 for the insight! x2 7) References got requests but I think it must be automatic from the online system because it was day after I applied?

The people I know who went to PC as students were not religious. I am an ex-Catholic and I'm applying to another position at PC, so I'm interested to see what others have to say.  3) Spring search was for VAP/adjunct positions so this is a new search! Many students and faculty at PC are not religious and/or a religion other than Catholic. 4) While the current employees are probably very accepting and not that religious, if asked during an interview about your religious affiliation or interest, my experience around other religiously affiliated universities tells me that there is, in fact, a right answer. 5) Faculty member in the department chiming in to say that few of us are religious, and that's perfectly fine as long as you can tolerate writing a response to the mission statement that addresses faith and reason as compatible, and as long as you're okay with super big crucifixes, it's a thing. Besides that stuff, we're always trying to be a more inclusive and welcoming department to students from all walks of life. 6) thanks @5 for the insight! x2 7) References got requests but I think it must be automatic from the online system because it was day after I applied? Anyone else get this? 8) @7, yes I got this too and my writers have been submitting letters (not sure they are supposed to though!) 7) @8 thanks for confirming. why must these application systems toy with us? I would love to think I was shortlisted, but oh well : /  9) @7 I didn't get any letter requests AFAIK so maybe they did just make a shortlist really quickly! 7) @9 thank you for giving me a bit of hope, it's very kind x2 10) Not the first time they say ""not letters needed until interview"", and then the systems automatically requests them at app. submission. This annoys me to no end bc. it make me look (in the eyes of my referees) that I'm not communicating.

I would prefer not to identify myself to the committee in this thread  AP) It's Anonymous Potato, not Anonymous Panda!

We argued against it but were told it was not up to us. @SC make sure you tell administration that you lost significant strong applicants because of their policy. Also this recent comment doens't seem to match what the previous SC comment about looking into upstream steps. There was clearly a dialogue there. Tell them next time they lost tons of good applicants because of the choice. 13) I have hear repeteadly from multiple search committees that rec letters tend to not be a real difference maker, and they are really good at introducing bias. They shouldn't be required at all (a ~5 minute conversation with the references of your short list candidates is really all you need). And if they are required, it definitely shouldn't be upfront! Most of them go unread... 14) the entitlement on this thread is shocking. SCs do not ""demand"" anything from anyone; it is a job posting. actually requiring 3 LORs up front might make the SC's job much easier by reducing the number of applicants to people who are willing to put in substantial up front effort 15) @14. Applicants caring about the time-sink that upfront letters mean to their letter-writers is the opposite of entitlement. SC's caring about their time, but not anyone else's time IS entitlement. 16) Deep breaths everybody. It's ok to just not apply for some jobs if you disagree with the posting. 17) I accidentally read the Virginia Tech update that said 311 people applied because I was only looking at the ""number applied"" column, which is 33, close to this job post. Any update on how many people applied to this position? I'm really hoping it's not 311., 18) I'm guessing it will be somewhere between 300-500... that's usually what happens with broad search like this one. 19) based on all the people who skipped this app because of the upfront letters I'm sure this search will fail! /s 20) Any word here? 21) With such a broad search and so many applicants, I expect it will be a while before anyone hears back from them. (22) SC seemed to indicate that they need letters up front because this process will be 'fast'—on the order of one or two weeks. If nobody's heard yet, I expect that requesting 900–1500 academic letters was a massive waste of everyone's time. (23) A few days ago I was asked by SC chair to have my missing LCs sent by end of November. (24) Well, that makes me think we won't hear anything until late November, early December. Also, that ref letters probably aren't being used to create an initial long list. (22 again) What a waste of everybody's time.

SCs do not ""demand"" anything from anyone; it is a job posting. actually requiring 3 LORs up front might make the SC's job much easier by reducing the number of applicants to people who are willing to put in substantial up front effort 15) @14. Applicants caring about the time-sink that upfront letters mean to their letter-writers is the opposite of entitlement. SC's caring about their time, but not anyone else's time IS entitlement. 16) Deep breaths everybody. It's ok to just not apply for some jobs if you disagree with the posting. 17) I accidentally read the Virginia Tech update that said 311 people applied because I was only looking at the ""number applied"" column, which is 33, close to this job post. Any update on how many people applied to this position? I'm really hoping it's not 311., 18) I'm guessing it will be somewhere between 300-500... that's usually what happens with broad search like this one. 19) based on all the people who skipped this app because of the upfront letters I'm sure this search will fail! /s 20) Any word here? 21) With such a broad search and so many applicants, I expect it will be a while before anyone hears back from them. (22) SC seemed to indicate that they need letters up front because this process will be 'fast'—on the order of one or two weeks. If nobody's heard yet, I expect that requesting 900–1500 academic letters was a massive waste of everyone's time. (23) A few days ago I was asked by SC chair to have my missing LCs sent by end of November. (24) Well, that makes me think we won't hear anything until late November, early December. Also, that ref letters probably aren't being used to create an initial long list. (22 again) What a waste of everybody's time. (25) Any updates, SC? 26) Just got a phone invite for an on-campus interview in January x2 27) Congrats! Out of curiousity: Are you Eco or Evo? 26) Evo x2 27) No initial zoom interviews? 28) nope, straight to in person 29) I am really curious about the profile of people that got invites. The ad was really broad, I wonder if the interest was actually broad or if they had something mroe specific in mind (30) Rejection recieved, indicates negotiations have begun. 31) @30, rejection also recieved (12/22), however it suggested that interviews were set to begin in January. x6 (30 again) Actually it seems that was a rejection for the computational position... I wonder if I am a backup or something for this one... My mistake!  32) Over 250 applicants.  33) Offer recieved (34) just recently? I thought an offer had been made a while ago?",42

I am interested in this job but a little worried about the reputation that the university turns a blind eye to this stuff . . .4) I have heard from >1 person that CC is toxic. :-/ 5) Thanks 3 I had seen that post but couldn't find it or remember the details. 6) wow...six women who were in a STEM tenure-track position left since 2014. I was really excited about the block schedule idea and the college in general, but this is something to think about 7) How realistic is the expectation of an active research program here, when they also have a six course-per-year teaching load? 8) It does not look like any of the faculty currently in this department have very active publishing records. I imagine it would be hard with 6 classes a year all in intense blocks, but maybe there is some different way of accounting for what 'counts' as a class here? 9) Based on my observations of other SLACs It is very likely that courses with a lab count as at least 1.5 or more likely 2 classes. I would be very curious to hear how the department would respond to the claims of 3, 4, and 6, but not curious enough to spend time applying just to find out it's all true. 10) I am a recently tenured woman in the hiring department. I am very happy with my department and broader institution and my experiences and those of many of my colleagues do not reflect what was written in the blog. 11) I want to apply, but the very tailored rec letters make me not want to, I don't want to use more of my references time. I don't know how much information they get from this letters when choosing candidates 12) I agree the upfront letters aren't ideal but I wouldn't consider one letter addressing teaching and one letter addressing research to be very tailored for a liberal arts school 13) Have any letter writers confirmed they recieved their automated email with letter writing instructions? My letter writers have not recieved such an email 14) They have a glitch with their HR portal, I reached out to them as only 2 of my letter writers received their emails, my third recommender received the email today, but I was told that late letters due to the glitch would not affect my application x 3 15) Any updates from anyone? 16) Nothing here (10/14) x8.

This seems like a huge oversight and hopefully will be taken into account reviewing applications. 23) So what does this mean for letters that come in from this point until the 7th (or 8th as my email says)? Are they still reviewed and is the candidate penalized? 24) Any word? 25) Nothing so far x7 26) Search Chair here - We have not made invitations for ShortList interviews. Because our Department is carrying out 2 searches this term, our timing is slower than we'd like. Thank you for your patience.

Did anyone get a rejection? 31) haven't heard anything yet 32) seems like they are in negotiations with someone, how many were invited on campus?

I saw a VAP position on their website but did not even see the Eco position on their website. TIA! 4) this is #2 again - yes, those are all TT positions but the listings are just getting going... expect to see more in the summer.  The ecology ad is one of the first to be posted, hot off the presses. 5) Very exciting! Thanks!  6) Any insights into living in Portland with a family on 60-70k? (serious question, not snarky) Seem to be few houses under half a million. 6) former longtime Portland resident here - that salary is not commensurate to the cost of living there x2 7) This would be difficult if your partner didn't also work. 8) How do you know the salary?  Nothing on the job ad and when I searched for Assistant Prof salary there it looked like more? 9) @8, what was the salary you saw posted then? 10) https://american-school-search.com/faculty/lewis-clark-college 11) does anyone know the teaching load for this position? - didn't see it listed in the ad 12) I believe it's ""rotating slate of five lecture or lab courses per academic year"" but honestly don't know enough about PUIs to know exactly what that means. 13) @10, that site is incredibly inflated - maybe they adjust all salaries to 12-month, even though most are 9-month? Whatever the reason, they say the average Asst Prof salary at my school is $85k, but its actually ~$65k. The best source I know is the Chronicle of Higher Ed Faculty Salary Survey (just google it). 14) I always liked the AAUP survey tool (https://www.aaup.org/faculty-compensation-survey-results-tool). It has been right on the money (zing!) the times I needed that info. @11&12, from my PUI expeience, five courses/labs usually means a 3-2 load. Everything that takes 3 hours per week counts as 1 so it can be  a course+lab one semester, and the same + a single lecture the next. Keep in mind some institutions have their own way to describe load. During interviews ALWAYS ASK for how your ACTUAL schedule for the 1st Fall and Spring will be like. 15)  FYI: The salaries reported on the AAUP page are for Lewis & Clark State College in Lewiston, ID; so, those are salaries at a different university 16) The Chronicle faculty salary database lists Lewis & Clark average assistant prof salary at $68k. It does seem unusually low compared to a handful of other comparably ranked/sized/funded colleges I looked up, especially when you factor in the local cost of living. 17) yeah that salary is nuts for SW Portland 18)@6 Yes, I am from Portland and you would be on a tight budget making 60/70k if your partner did not also work, especially if paying for childcare- F/T preschool/daycare is around 1.3k/ mo, nannies charge around $25/hr. If you don't mind a longer commute, there are areas with lower cost housing. Also, teaching load at LC is as the person above stated (3/2 I believe) and 68k could be right- starting faculty salaries in Portland are often lower than NIH postdoc salary requirements- but it does seem low for a private school. It's a tough city for an academic, but also close to amazing, beautiful natural landscapes!  19) I currently live in Portland on a ~67K postdoc salary and can confirm that it's a tough salary; I rent a small home with my partner, and get by, but its tough to save / grow wealth (e.g., to buy a home); I love living in Portland enough to apply anyway, but would push hard for a more reasonable salary if given the chance. 20) application requires graduate transcripts - unclear if unofficial ones are acceptable at first. Also, no diversity statement requested, but cover letter should address DEI. Finally, the ad doesn't mention requiring evidence of teaching effectiveness, but the online system has a spot to upload this and says its required.  21) Per dept member - unofficial transcripts ok at application stage; official ones likely necessary before offer or with background check stage. Wide flexibility on additional teaching/research documents (plus checking which are req'd in interfolio set up). Search chair happy to answer questions. 22) Q for the search chair - is it possible to get a rough range for the salary of this position? +1 23) Any updates anyone? 24) Nothing here (10/11) x10. 25) I am really curious how many applications they had: over-under my money is > 300 and my point guess would be 366. 26) so if you're right @25, and only ~10 of us (~3% of applicants)  haven't heard anything, they could likely be already doing campus interviews and we would not know :(  27) I dunno, it seems unlikely that they could get through 360 applications quickly enough to be doing interviews already. But who knows on the applicant numbers! A couple years ago, I saw a little less than 250 applicants for a top R1 EBIO dept... seems like guesswork to me! Hang tight folks. 28.) Other positions at L&C (posted later in other depts) are already interviewing. Anyone have an update on where this search is at? 29) No updates here 10/26. But that’s discouraging to hear, @28.
