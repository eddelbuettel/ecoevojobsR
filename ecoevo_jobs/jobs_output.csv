Recived email from department head saying that they will ask for letters later. 10) Any news? 11) @10 none here! x8 12) Heard they met on the 1st to weed it down.13) seems they didn't get very far? still nothing here x9 14) No updates as of 11/15 (x3) 15) still no updates, as of 11/20! 16) Insider info - committee has not finalized yet; however, if you don't have an NSF grant already cross this one off your list. 17) Hopefully they are considering any big grants from other funding bodies, including non-US ones. 18) So they are only hiring associate professors? (e.g. those with established lead investigator NSF grants)? 19) So... any news? Have associate professors been invited for interviews? 20) Why would having funding mean only associate profs? Plenty of assistants and even some advanced postdocs or research associates, etc, have NSF or similar grants. Still frustrating if that is really true...no way to even apply as a PI while a postdoc at many instutitions. 21) I take it to mean they had so many qualified candidates that they can be extremely selective x2 22) Sure, but thats true of many desireable R1 searches and major grant funding isn't a huge consideration in many searches (of the last 10-15 candidates at my postdoc R1 that is, I think, more generally desirable than UK only 2-3 invited candidates had major funding). 23) any news? 24) Nope x 10^5 lol 25) on campus invite 12/9 x3 25) Just curious: is it true what #16 said? Those with campus invites are already funded? Best of luck to you all. 26)SC here: interviews set; did NOT require prior major grant",37,R1

Be very careful about applyng/accepting a job here. 4) Looks like they are hiring three positions. 5) Can confirm. I taught there briefly. The two old department chairs were very incompetent and left no room for independent thought. The current dean does everything he can to kow tow to the VP and Presdient. The fculty voted no confidence for the current president and two VPs were fired. One former faculty member is suing the college and individuals because they solicited student complaints to justify not giving him tenure becuase he blew the whistle on illicit actvity by some tenured members of the department. He's suig them for several million dollars, 6) Unsure about the BIO department and the problems there. Sounds shady. Can give loads of positives about the JC and SR in general. My dad was a faculty in the Math department for his career, and absolutley loved it. He had a really strong work community, and things seemed fairly smooth with politics, etc. Santa Rosa is a great town and an awesome place to grow up/raise a family. If they sort out the issues in BIO, would probably be a good position for someone looking for a CC/JC career. 7) I can second that SRJC at least used to be a great place to be a student. The training I received there inspired me to be an academic ecologist. SRJC has a transfer agreement with the CSU and UCs. This was really a great school, and I hope it still is.

Be very careful about applyng/accepting a job here. 4) Looks like they are hiring three positions. 5) Can confirm. I taught there briefly. The two old department chairs were very incompetent and left no room for independent thought. The current dean does everything he can to kow tow to the VP and Presdient. The fculty voted no confidence for the current president and two VPs were fired. One former faculty member is suing the college and individuals because they solicited student complaints to justify not giving him tenure becuase he blew the whistle on illicit actvity by some tenured members of the department. He's suig them for several million dollars, 6) Unsure about the BIO department and the problems there. Sounds shady. Can give loads of positives about the JC and SR in general. My dad was a faculty in the Math department for his career, and absolutley loved it. He had a really strong work community, and things seemed fairly smooth with politics, etc. Santa Rosa is a great town and an awesome place to grow up/raise a family. If they sort out the issues in BIO, would probably be a good position for someone looking for a CC/JC career. 7) I can second that SRJC at least used to be a great place to be a student. The training I received there inspired me to be an academic ecologist. SRJC has a transfer agreement with the CSU and UCs. This was really a great school, and I hope it still is. X3 8) The school was great but the current president has been very bad. The biology department has some very bad people in it and a few good ones. 9) First round of interview invites sent out 2/4",2,Other

Well when I applied for ths spatial ecologist one last year, I got a nice rejection letter pretty quickly, so at least you know quickly :).  8) @5 good luck. one of the best department in natural resource management, 9) I did my PhD at CSU. It is a really awesome place! I'm suprised they asked for, ...""2-3 page single statement addressing research, teaching, extension and diversity/inclusion"". That's tough! 10) the last 2 places I've been interested in have asked for a document like this.

Seems kinda specific... 5) @4 I'd guess that this is the laundry list of areas they'd like to fill over the next X years, not all requirements for THIS person. 6) Same add, but looks like someone was hired from the last search (from their web) 7) I was told by someone on their hiring comm last year that they were getting funding for another position this year, so this is a separate search. 8) this is a new search, last position was filled sucessfully and certainly no targeting of any ""inside hires"" 9) Are letters requested automatically? x2 10) How are people handling submission of 'Required List of References' and 'Required List of References Contact Information'? Do they want the same list of references twice? Am I missing something? Also, @ 9, letters were requested automatically upon submission. 10) Wow, this is a truly confusing application. First is the request for both 'Required List of References' and 'Required List of References Contact Information' under the ""Applicant Documents"" tab, which would seem to be the same thing. Further, there is the distinct ""Reference Letters"" tab for this application. From my experience with a very similar application system, I believe the ""Reference Letters"" tab to simply be a default application component that is not removed, even when the committee does not require letters of reference for initial review. If you put in your reference contact information into the ""Reference Letters"" tab, that's what triggers an immediate request for letters upon submission. In this case, I would think the best thing to do is leave the ""Reference Letters"" tab entirely blank (unless you want to trigger emails to all of those folks) and simply put the contact information in the (two) relevant documents in the ""Applicant Documents"" tab. 11) @ 10: were you able to successfully submit while leaving the ""Reference Letters"" tab blank? 12) @11 this is 10 again. I have not actually submitted my application for this job yet, I just learned my lesson with this particular HR system a few weeks ago for a different application where I both filled out the ""Reference Letters"" tab AND attached reference contact info only to find out letters were immediately requested for a job that was only asking for contact info. Not the worst thing in the world, but if the whole point of the committee's decision to only ask for contact info is to save letter writers time, it's very frustrating the application makes it seem like the ""Reference Letters"" tab is mandatory when I don't believe it is. If I go to the ""Check for Errors and Submit"" tab right now, it's only alerting me that I have missing ""Applicant Documents"". So I don't believe the ""Reference Letters"" tab is mandatory for submission. Seems like a stock HR application form that they didn't modify in accordance with what the committe actually asks for. 13) Wouldn't let me submit until I filled in the ""Reference Letters"" tab. Guess they *really* want reference information. 14) Are people having their letter writers submit letters then? 15) I did. Seems better safe than sorry. If they already have a letter for you, this is not a big time commitment to ask. 16) Seems like someone should contact the chair of the search comittee to clarify how they want to handle references. I just emailed HR and asked. Will update here if they get back to me. 17) I also just emailed HR, and will also provide update if I hear! 18) HR did not take it very seriously. Just told me to fill everything out. Would not provide departmental contact. Email dept chair? 18) I submitted the application with just contact info (in all 3 places) and they emailed references immediately, so that seemed fine x3, 19) I'm going to try and submit with NA in the form field for references. It's clear from the ad that they don't want letters from everyone. 20) NA in form field for references seems to work. X2 21) any updates? 22) None here! x8 23) I heard from a faculty member that the committee was planning to meet for the first time on 11/14 so I imagine they are still early on in the process. 24) I've been watching the analytics from my personal website and seen that someone from Rutgers looked at it, so at least they're looking at applications x2 25) Invited for Skype interview x7 26) If the doodle poll is accurate they are interviewing around a dozen via skype. Good luck all! 27) my skype call is scheduled for Dec 9. Is that the only day calls are happening or are there others? 28) mine is also Dec 9 x2 29) Too many phone interviews...whats the point of interviewing 12+? 30) Does anyone have insight into when they will make requests for on campus interviews? 31) They said on-campus interviews mid-Jan to early-Feb, and that we should expect to hear ""soon"" 32) @31 thanks! x2 33) anyone receive an on campus invite yet? 34) nope 12/17 (x6) 35) Just got a campus invite! @_@ x2",33,FALSE,"We are looking especially for organismally-focused field ecologists and/or evolutionary ecologists who are working with or useTORN any of the following in their research program, including any combination of: field studies, soil ecology, microbes, plant biology, evolutionary genomics, transcriptomics, and/or evolutionary ecology.

You will be notified via e-mail once initiated."" 5) Yes, that's exactly what happens - the system automatically emails your referees, then you get a confirmation email. 6) Right. I guess I was concerned because 3 et al said it looked like letter requests were sent. 7) 3 here. My letters have already been submitted--I got an email saying each of the three had uploaded their letters. Presumably they received a generated prompt to do so. 8) 4/6 here. Hmm. Ok, I suppose it's safe to assume they aren't considering me then; the status under references still says ""not sent"". Out of curiousity, did it seem like your references got the prompt to submit their letter right away? 9) 7 here--I got email notifications that my references had uploaded letters on the 2nd. Only saw the posting late in the evening the night prior to the deadline, so I'm not sure if they were sent out right away and my references sent the letters first thing when they got to work Monday, or if they were requested Monday morning. 10) Ok, thanks. Seems like it should have automatically requested letters... I emailed the help desk. These online portals can be maddening. 11) Beats mailing out physical copies in manila envelopes though! 12) True. 10 here again... got a generic response that said the system prompts references to submit letters once the employer tells it to do so... which means they must have reviewed applications right away and done their first cut on Monday morning? Seems unlikely to me but maybe I was overly optimistic about my qualifications. 12) I think the emails to references were sent automatically upon submitting the application. Once they submitted the letters, applicants received the email notifying them about the submission of letters. 13) Odd, none of my references received an email prompt. When I emailed the helpdesk they said the search committee initiates this step.. 14) 2 of my references received an auto response, so I went back and followed the directions to resend the requests, which then worked for the third reference. 15) anyone know if they started online interviews? 16) No update, no x5 17) I emailed the chair.

This is the dark underside of Germany academia, they (PIs) will cut up positions to increase their overall productivity. So, imagine having a part time assistant professor position for 4 years (and build up a team as group leader) with the expected output (several papers per year) so you can get another job somewhere, on half the income.  3) @2 I assumed that was as a possible accomodation for dual-career couples. 4) could be, but two people splitting one salary is pretty bad.

I agree two people with one salary sucks, but one salary with your partner not having a position at all (in the same place) is even worse. Two low paying positions far apart means double the housing costs and a ton of travel costs and is impossible if you have kids. Dual-career postdoc stage just sucks all around...so this at least seems like it could be a modest improvement. 6) the problem is that with half a salary, you'll contribute half to your retirement but will need full retirement when you do retire.
